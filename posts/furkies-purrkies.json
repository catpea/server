      "text": "Well, from the first moment on,\nwe are asked if we should live in harmony.\n\nWe are still very young,\nbarely know of the world.\n\nAnd already the question of harmony comes,\nand in harmony we learn, and thrive.\n\nAway from it, we'll be interrupted,\nand feel lost in the void.\n\nIt is a simple choice,\nbut out minds are not ready to make it.\n\nOften we forget.\n\nWe forget about our little gardens,\nand all the little walks.\n\nWe forget how amazing it felt,\nto stand on the wing of a plane.\n\nWe forget the taste of popcorn at the Zoo,\nor even how enormous Zoo felt.\n\nWe forget pebbles at the river,\nand mischievous squires at the park.\n\nThat little dog with a bark,\nthat scaredy kitten always hiding in the dark.\n\nOur collection of unused keys,\nand the box of bottle caps we collected with ease.\n\nWe forgot our Lego and the old bike,\nwith that seat that we used to really like.\n\nWe don't remember the Palaces and Castles,\nthat we used to love, and those swords, that fit us like a glove.\n\nEverybody else came around,\nacting like they know the ground.\n\nBut, this was our gift from the Universe,\nan affinity for flowering gardens, and little passage ways, and all those flying planes.\n\nIt was a key to unlock our mind,\nto understand the zoo, and our size in the universe, connect with pebbles at the beach.\n\nIt is a pathway that fits us best,\nto love little creatures, and collect some shineys, and build with blocks, and ride far and wide.\n\nIt was to remind us,\nto find our place among Great Beings, and study and pursue excellence, in all we do.\n\nThen they sent us to First Grade,\nand the weird kid peed into the Duplo, they didn't even have Lego.\n\nThen the teacher graded you down for counting pebles in your pocket,\nand did it so many times, you lost track.\n\nThere was a whisper about the pebbles,\nit was Mr. Sagan - \"You are made of Star Stuff.\"\n\nAnd then the kids whispered...\nto push you in the mud.\n\nPush their laughter aside,\nyou'll need to Learn, and learn really hard.\n\nCause right now, you're in the mud,\nand you need to hang on.\n\nIt will get worse,\nbut all you have to do is rise.\n\nEach time,\nyou'll rise higher.\n\n(When in trouble, call the Police it is OK for kids to call the Police, they'll love helping you, don't be scared.)\n\nThird Grade,\nFifth Grade.\n\nLow grade,\nUhh, but there can't be higher.\n\nBecause by this time, you're getting bad grades,\nbecause the teacher thinks you're copying from somewhere.\n\nThe bullies know,\nyou did it on your own.\n\nSaw you pacing for days,\nwith your first program.\n\nKeep going forward,\ndon't let go - you're doing great, stay away from the hate.\n\nBy the time you're out of Eight Grade,\nby rejecting crazy, and nonsense, and stupid, and lazy, you graduate above all others.\n\nBecause you didn't follow,\nbecause you chose to study on your own, at your own pace.\n\nBecause worthless grades meant nothing,\nyou felt no stress.\n\nBecause, you didn't follow\nnothing could hurt you.\n\nAnd your world is yours,\ntruly-truly yours.\n\nWe unravel, when we forget who we are,\nthe moment we hide, or pretend, or follow.\n\nAnd, gosh darn it,\nit happens when we are still kids.\n\nWe are completely unprepared,\nand none will help.\n\nSo you! have to keep it together,\nyou can't let anyone hurt your mind.\n\nIn High School, the pretenders make a sudden appearance,\nnever held a book in their hand.\n\nThe back of Hamlet,\nall the quotes have more IQ.\n\nLet the little Caesars,\nkeep the wind from the hall away.\n\nYou need to pace your reading at the library,\nteach yourself focus.\n\nDon't EVER! finish the books,\njust get to the part that is valuable to you, and skip the rest.\n\nStart working on your start-up early,\nit is a study in failure.\n\nYou need to create a series of CONTROLLED FAILURES,\nthis is very important.\n\nLearn [content management][1],\nand figure out [billing][2]\n\nThat's your surface platform,\nand think about nature of business.\n\nNever try to build things directly,\nfacilitate the building of direct things for others.\n\nHelp them setup,\nso that you are not burdened, and keep going.\n\nLook at the structure of start-up accelerators, or even banks,\nthey take a percent, and never create what will weigh them down.\n\nEventually, you can build your own Tesla,\nbut at first, you start with services.\n\nLook at the gym,\nmonthly subscription, is most stable.\n\nThe lessons, are all around you.\n\nYou don't need college,\nbut taking college classes is very relaxing.\n\nMake sure you get a 4.0 at each class,\nbe ready to repeat it.\n\nAnd enjoy,\nthe lectures.\n\nCollege is just a toy,\nit looks bad on your Portfolio, so hide it.\n\nIt is a very weak teaching experience,\nand people know that there there is minimal learning involved.\n\nJumping from high school to start-ups is more impressive,\nand shows that you chose knowledge over nonsense.\n\nIt shows that you chose to learn on your own,\nto take care of your own mind,\nrather than to pretend to learn for grades.\n\nAuthenticity is very important in life,\nit is hard to connect with people that role play.\n\nBonding with people that are just acting,\nis only functional for as long as they are acting.\n\nBut it is never good,\neventually they'll have a crisis, similar to a mid-life crisis.\n\nStay Authentic,\nkeep to to those who are Authentic.\n\nBe safe.\n\nWhen it feels like everyone else is having an amazing life,\nand you are stuck.\n\nUmm... that not true\n\nBut it is also not healthy to think this way about yourself,\nyou are not beneath the party goers, they don't have what you have in your mind.\n\nBut, that's far enough,\ntime to get some rest.\n\nThis is where it gets interesting,\nyou have primed your mind for Business.\n\nThat is a fine first step,\nnow you need to get ready for the real graduation.\n\nYou need to section hike the equivalent of the Appalachian Trail,\nand measure your jogging a hundred miles at a time.\n\nSection jogging, the Western States 100.\n\nMind and Body, for the rest of your life.\n\nYou must take good care of both.\n\nAt mile fifty, halfway through a run,\nas you piece together your blurry thoughts of your next business.\n\nTake some time to understand what it is that College Grads have,\nthose are very brittle relationships, and inflexible careers.\n\nWe all feel the promise, but we can't fake it,\nit would be the opposite, and certainly not worthy of you, my Friends.\n\nYou can only find your meaning in Authenticity,\nshortcuts will only take you back to the beginning.\n\nTo live among the Extraordinary,\nyou must become Extraordinary yourself.\n\nThe gateway to Meaning of Life,\nis in that tiny moment when you think to your self:\n\n\"I am not going to jog tonight, I need rest.\"\n\nRight there in that dot,\nis the keyhole,\nto the key that you are,\nto the gateway that you need to open.\n\nLife is not a simulation,\nthere are no days off,\nlife is quite a challenge,\nand demands that each moment builds on the authenticity of the previous.\n\nOpen the dot, how can you yearn for Authenticity and Companionship,\nand cancel, and fall short, and not enough, and rest some more.\n\nThe gateway between Ordinary and Extraordinary,\nis in accepting that we haven't got a choice to make.\n\nBut shoes... to put on,\nyour Mind and Body must grow in harmony.\n\nYou must not let go of the Harmony,\nof your Magnificent Existence.\n\nEach small success, by subtle analogy,\npushes you forward, to your next step.\n\nEventually your tightly controlled business failures,\nwill fail, they will, fail to fail.\n\nYour mind too,\nit won't perceive the easy choice as an option.\n\nAll- will proceed,\nin harmony.\n\nLabored breathing,\nby the Pine Trees at Western States,\n\nAnother great step in Automation of your business,\nand more investors.\n\nAnd you're no longer stopping at the first thing you find in books,\nyou understand all of it.\n\nWhat is made by humans,\nis also All Too Human.\n\nAnd the Bullies are Gone,\nand Eight Grade still sucks.\n\nHigh school ... influences,\nare trying to figure out where they went wrong - good luck!\n\nCollege, is still a very romantic idea,\nbut it is best left to imagination.\n\nYour dreams are so much more now,\nonly what you create can live up to them.\n\nYou are a Leader,\nfull of might an joy.\n\nAnd now you know,\nshortcuts only lead people to their beginnings.\n\nAnd the one road, the only road,\nwas the one of Authenticity, and Achievement.\n\nWhere we learned for real, not for grades,\nwhere what we learned added up to create wisdom, and not a stupid GPA.\n\nYou'll be OK, so as long as you Learn onward and become Wise,\nand Live in Authentic Harmony with Yourself.\n\nThis is how you become an Adult,\nthat was the one thing that all others were missing.\n\nIt's what made them pretend and simulate,\nbut, growing up can't be faked.\n\nGrowing up has to be written by the choices you make,\non the surface, that is your lifetime.\n\nThe dreams you always dream, will come true,\nbut not in your childhood, childhood is for learning.\n\nLive in Harmony with yourself,\nand live in harmony with the Universe.\n\nGrowing up is really special,\nit is really important for our health.\n\nIt is a deeply internal process,\nand there are no shortcuts to growing up.\n\nIt is meant to be,\nBeautiful.\n\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=content+management\n[2]:

special.\n\nBut there is one exception.\n\nOnce you come down to Earth, come up to Life, and look then Into The Conscious Self Aware Mind,\nthat is no longer a common occurrence.\n\nThere is nothing normal about it,\nwe are now at the limits of what the Universe could possibly conceive of.\n\nNo machine or hybrid can measure up to the raw power of unleashed consciousness.\n\nNothing partially conscious, can know the depth of Sadness,\nnothing less than conscious could know the Miracle of Happiness.\n\nWe are used to thinking of ourselves as work horses,\ngreat locomotives that can plow through Pandemics, or a Broken Heart.\n\nBut that is a temporary oversimplification just to keep visions clear,\nborn of a finely tuned mind that can narrow all views down to the important bits.\n\nFocus and selective attention is not a limitation of our mind,\nit is a feature that clears away unimportant things.\n\nWhen we need recall, we can have it in full,\njust imagine your favorite place, and trace along the walls.\n\nEvery window, picture, appliance, and outlet, all the important knickknacks are all there,\nwe don't have memory problems, we don't need better brains.\n\nThe convergence that we need is not about integrating with technology,\nbut combining the good parts of our cultures, so that the world can learn towards Peace.\n\nWithout that shared wisdom, people are easily tricked to believe in conflict,\ninto the belief that there are borders, and across borders they must fight.\n\nBy not helping each other to understand how special and unique we each are,\nthere grows a vocal minority of machine like minds, that think in mechanical terms.\n\nThey add to get more, they take to be more,\nthey divide to make enemy, and subtract enemy to spread more.\n\nThey think they are a cog, in a bigger machine,\nbut there is no machine, just that blind mind.\n\nIt is OK to focus on just a few things so that we may grow, and grow in wisdom too,\nbut it is not OK to live in some narrow channel for simplicity sake.\n\nIt actually isn't OK to do things to simplify,\ncomplexity only moves in one direction.\n\nThere is nothing healthy that can be done to un-mix a cup of tea,\nthere is nothing useful to be found in moving backwards in time.\n\nComplexity grows, and to make sense of growing complexity,\nwe cannot hope to simplify it, but rather adapt our minds to grasp it more efficiently.\n\nThe World must Go Forward, Move Forward,\nwhat needs to change is out Tolerance for Bad Ideas.\n\nBut growing up to the challenges of ever increasing complexity requires wisdom,\nand wisdom cannot be manufactured, it must be grown.\n\nWisdom is a product of Love,\nnot the Beating Heart, but the Human Capacity to Love the Universe, The World, and The Human Family.\n\nMy Dear Readers,\nBecoming a Great Being, becoming Wise and Enlightened,\nis the actual definition of being an Adult.\n\nPretending to be an Adult, by acting mature,\nis to make a fool of yourself, probably while throwing away what makes you Beautiful.\n\nThrowing away your Sweetens, and Foolishness, and Innocence, and all the Smiles that happen for no reason.\nThat's not growing up, that's the worst thing you can do to your self, and is probably very unhealthy.\n\nTo become an Adult,\nis to become a Philosopher.\n\nPhilosophy is about Loving Wisdom,\nis your Wisdom not the most precious thing within you?\n\nUniverse, the biggest thing there is, in all it's might and complexity,\na thing so powerful, that it may in some part, travel around it self in time.\n\nIt can't do wisdom, best it can do is Evolution,\nbut it can't do wisdom, it cannot know, it doesn't know such a thing could exist.\n\nAnd each and every one of us has the capacity for it,\na volitional faculty to bring up a folder of your Noblest Thoughts.\n\nYou are more powerful than the Universe,\nthe only thing that can keep you down,\nis you never becoming aware of your Great Power.\n\nI know Superman comes to mind when you think of Superpowers and Superheroes,\nBut do think Superman is actually super because he can lift or fly?\n\nIf Superman was as super as he needs to be, he would become Human,\nand build Schools to prevent War a Hundred Years before it happened.\n\nHe'd then age, so that the Little Ones,\nwould listen to him without dismissing him as a Genius that lives on cloud nine.\n\nHe'd then let the little ones build with a thousand minds,\nwhat his one mind, couldn't grasp.\n\nThe greatest of superheroes, would encourage us to build things,\nthat help the world to converge,\non Cultures of Wisdom that leave bad ideas behind.\n\nI ask you, My Dear Readers,\nto begin moving towards becoming Great Wise Beings,\ntowards growing up by means of searching for wisdom,\ngrowing all the way up so that you stand as Authentic Adults.\n\nAnd rising to the challenge of inspiring a thousand minds,\nto accomplish what your one mind, can only barely conceive of today.",

believe life emerged, on Earth,</p>\n  <p>just like we wanted to believe that earth was the center of the Universe.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And we want to believe that Earth was the first to have life,</p>\n  <p>my goodness, how much more special could we be, the first in the Universe.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Universe is a large place, that has been around for a long time,</p>\n  <p>it is better not to think of anything cosmic, as that! special.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But there is one exception.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Once you come down to Earth, come up to Life, and look then Into The Conscious Self Aware Mind,</p>\n  <p>that is no longer a common occurrence.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>There is nothing normal about it,</p>\n  <p>we are now at the limits of what the Universe could possibly conceive of.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>No machine or hybrid can measure up to the raw power of unleashed consciousness.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Nothing partially conscious, can know the depth of Sadness,</p>\n  <p>nothing less than conscious could know the Miracle of Happiness.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>We are used to thinking of ourselves as work horses,</p>\n  <p>great locomotives that can plow through

all views down to the important bits.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Focus and selective attention is not a limitation of our mind,</p>\n  <p>it is a feature that clears away unimportant things.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When we need recall, we can have it in full,</p>\n  <p>just imagine your favorite place, and trace along the walls.</p>\n</div>\n<div

more.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>They think they are a cog, in a bigger machine,</p>\n  <p>but there is no machine, just that blind mind.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is OK to focus on just a few things so that we may grow, and grow in wisdom too,</p>\n  <p>but it is not OK to live in some narrow channel for simplicity sake.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It actually isn&apos;t OK to do things to simplify,</p>\n  <p>complexity only moves in one direction.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>There

to make sense of growing complexity,</p>\n  <p>we cannot hope to simplify it, but rather adapt our minds to grasp it more efficiently.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The World must Go Forward, Move Forward,</p>\n  <p>what needs to change is out Tolerance for Bad Ideas.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But growing up to the challenges of ever increasing complexity requires

will help you see with great clarity.\n\nA Life of Wisdom.\n\nBut you must be careful,\nas the world may not yet be ready to help you.\n\nNot everyone will know about growing up,\nand people will say: \"How was I supposed to know?\"\n\nAnd they are not going to be the bad guys,\nand you will be inclined to listen to their advice.\n\nAnd the path will be paved with good intentions,\nit maybe the correct path, but it won't be the right one.\n\nPlease, focus on building your own self,\nyour strength, your wisdom, your power.\n\nFocus on building the best you,\nthe you that you are meant to be, that the world needs.\n\nBecause if you listen to everybody else,\nyou will not grow up, and they will blame you for not being able to help them.\n\nYou are not going to be able to explain to them,\nthat you are weak because of them,\nbecause you tried to help them too early.\n\nAnd if you could, all they could say will be:\n\"How was I supposed to know?\"\n\nPlease, you have no choice,\nbut to learn to control your own future.\n\nYou can try to use your imagination,\nto get in touch with your Elder Self;\n\nAnd ask \"What are your regrets?\",\n\"Where did it go wrong?\"\n\nPlease, carefully evaluate your choices,\nwisely build your Mind and Body.\n\nPay attention to all the choices you are making,\nas they dictate the Beautiful Life Ahead of You.\n\nThe teachers are not ready, we are not in the Era of Wisdom yet,\npeople are struggling to understand life.\n\nMany make choices that all too early box them in,\nand not all their advice will apply to you.\n\nNot all the things that you think box people in,\nactually constrain them, there are many contexts to all the paths.\n\nAll lives are beautiful, and there are enough forks in the road,\nfor people to navigate back to where they want to be.\n\nBut, when a mistake occurs, it will weigh you down for a time,\nif you are careful, you can avoid the worst of it.\n\nAnd whatever does happen, regardless of how hard you tried to avoid it,\nwill not crush you, because you will know you did your best.\n\nPlease, be careful in life, be beautiful, and strong,\nlearn, and think, and evaluate, and judge, and grow in wisdom.\n\nFollowing everyone's advice, will create a lot of noise,\nlistening to everything from everywhere will never align with you.\n\nYou must lean to pace yourself,\nand to carefully and wisely follow what interests you.\n\nYour mind is constantly asking questions,\nyour future depends on having a good intuition, rooted in reality, and in wisdom.\n\nThere is nothing you can be force-taught school,\nyou will not retain things that are out of sequence.\n\nReaching out for Knowledge and Wisdom in your own sequence, and at your own pace,\nis the only way to learn, and build steps, and build on top of those steps.\n\nNo one can decide what lesson you are ready for next,\nthat is something that comes from the complexity of your own mind.\n\nThose people who are doing well in school without cramming and memorization,\nhave previously arrived at those subjects in their own sequence.\n\nThe same applies to your job, your career,\nyour career needs to emerge from the path you were growing up with.\n\nIt needs to be an an extension of your pursuits,\nit must benefit you, and help you grow.\n\nJust like you must actually learn, instead of just getting grades,\nyour work must add to you, and not, rob you of your years.\n\nDo you understand the value of a Single Year of Your Precious Life?\nno one can put a price on that, not even you, there are not enough atoms in the Universe.\n\nThat is why Harmony with Education, and Work is so important,\neach year must be lived on the path that makes you grow.\n\nI am so sorry, that people will tell you to cram for tests,\nand get a job, and get on with life.\n\nI am so sorry, My Friends,\nbut that is the worst, you can do.\n\nThat's why you can't listen to anyone,\nthat's why you have to look into yourself.\n\nCarefully evaluate all decisions,\nwhilst carefully evaluating consequences, and being mindful of your future.\n\nYou are not alone, look to Memoirs, look to Biographies,\nlisten to Audiobooks, Explore, and Create.\n\nAnd you must take care of your body,\nthe best you can, at first.\n\nAnd with each year,\nyou will gain more, and add a bit more as you grow in Health and Fortitude.\n\nYour Elder Self needs to be Flexible, and Healthy,\nyou may never grunt and complain, that's something you have to be mindful of now.\n\nIt is not just about making choices for your Future,\nbut also for your body too.\n\nDo you see how going along with cramming for tests,\ncan put you in a field where your job makes life more stressful,\nwhich will prevent you from taking good care of your body?\n\nImagine the consequences of walking a path that is not truly your own,\nand what will your Elder Self feel when you two finally become, One?\n\nBe gentle with yourself,\nthis is Your Life, Your Beautiful-Beautiful Life.\n\nPut down the incomprehensible Text Book, the standardized tests,\nand find an Audiobook that you will love and actually learn from.\n\nStop trying to find a job or get hired, and become the kind of a person;\nthat companies can only hope to hire.\n\nStart living healthy, years before you start your training,\ndo not force your body into endurance, gradually teach it to adapt.\n\nChose Audio-books that really help your wisdom grow,\nembrace your hobbies, and expand your adventures.\n\nIf you can't find a career path that will add onto you,\nthen start your own company,\nor become a co-founder.\n\nTake care of your body, be mindful of you Body Mass Index,\nbut also aim to become a Healthy Athlete, Heath will never take away from you.\n\nIn all we do, in choices, or intuitions,\nwe re driven by the wisdom we have thus far acquired.\n\nA decision that made sense in your youth,\nmay reverse, as you gain wisdom from Books and

to remind us that the World is Not Static,\nthat it grows, moves, changes, and cares not to stop for things writ on paper.\n\nAdvancements in Psychology... the trailer to the movie about Philip Zimbardo work -

      "text": "We are not Island Universes scattered to no end in some void,\nwe are a part of a growing civilization with a past and a future.\n\nAnd we might have become confused about the Scope of Our Existence,\nwe stand divided by borders and committed to repeating history's mistakes.\n\nIt is unwise to pretend to be able to handle a great responsibility,\nonly desperation, fractures, and exploitation by other desperate pretenders can follow.\n\nThose who are granted authority are often not wise enough to handle it,\nand in their mediocrity they commit what in larger scope translates to real Crimes Against Humanity.\n\nThere cannot be wisdom without understanding and inheriting from past generations,\nthe transfer of knowledge occurs by means of Understanding Books.\n\nAnd there cannot be understanding without Authenticity,\nin haste of chasing a career there can only be memorization and misunderstanding.\n\nWe must keep in mind; that what the future generations do not perceive as clear progress,\nwill be seen as the continuation of dark ages with authorities on the wrong side of history.\n\nThe World United, is not a fairy-tale, nor should it be a mere dream for us,\nbut a Gift of Peace for The Future Generations, so that they may grow in Dignity, Health, and Wisdom.\n\nWe are neither disconnected from the future generations, nor the past generations,\nwe are a stepping stone in the development of The Human Kind.\n\nAnd we should recognize this Great Honor and Reward,\nand understand that the larger context is found in helping to build a better world for future generations.\n\nAll our decisions, across all levels and authorities,\nPolice, Attorneys and Judges, Parents, Teachers and Principals, Mayors, Governors, Prime Misters and Presidents, and everybody else...\n\nMust be mindful of future generations, of a growing world, of making lasting and meaningful contributions to the entire human kind,\na World that will eventually become united and free of borders.\n\nA world with future generations that will look back at us,\nright now, right here, with questions that we must present answers to.\n\nWe are getting stuck in circles,\nbecause people are forgetting history's lessons.\n\nBecause we are not thinking on a large enough scale,\nwe end up building more prisons rather than ending poverty with meaningful prevention programs.\n\nEndless cycles of heartless poverty that freeze the best of us,\npoverty that wouldn't even be a feature of modern society had we in our wisdom recognized it for what it is.\n\nPoverty denies people food and well being,\ncauses stress and great harm to mind and body.\n\nLove above Law, before we allow the practice of law,\nwe must end the cycles of poverty.\n\nMoney must not be used to limit people,\nit is meant to help.\n\nAnd how can a culture be to fail to see, how a young person allowed to build a business without the threat of homelessness and starvation,\nwill contribute back to the city and everyone's well being.\n\nWhat is so hard about seeing that rather than sending non-violent criminals to prison,\nwe can prevent their biggest mistakes by putting an end to their worries of sleeping hungry on the street.\n\nAny time, we fail to keep to reality,\nbe it sending a 15 year old lady to prison, or denying science, or tolerating arrests by obscured or unidentified agencies, or abuses of power or discretion.\n\nWe create fractures and distrust,\nblindly defacing and destroying work of many much wiser great beings, who gave their best trusting that we can carry on, in wisdom.\n\nWe must not move against the grain of reality,\nany and all divergence will only create a cascade of fractures that will demand constant attention\nand result in nothing more than systems that merely stand to support themselves and as an affront to justice and future generations.\n\nWhere there was once a solution as clear as helping children to inherit the wisdom of their elders,\nwe now see the emergence of a failed and impotent educational system with a mass incarceration backed.\n\nWisdom and inheritance of knowledge cannot be replaced by a \"fake it until you make it\" trickery,\nthe work of great beings must not be stained by people who fail to see their vision.\n\nOnce again, the world grows a generation at a time,\nthe education of the teenagers from 20 years ago is currently influencing the state of the world.\n\nLikewise, how we treat out children today,\nwill have a monumental impact on the world 20 years from now.\n\nLet us honor our children and all the future generations by encouraging them to books,\nby reminding them of the Great Power of Thinking Beings, of Philosophers and Lovers of Wisdom.\n\nBy reminding them that their Pursuit of Excellence,\ncan only make the world a better place for us all, and even those that are yet to come.\n\nLet us remind them that Books (and now Audio Books) serve as a wonderful source of our wisdom,\nespecially when read in a sequence that fits them best, and understood at thier own pace.\n\nLet us remind each other that we must reject short thinking and shortest paths,\nthat do not help the world grow and keep us divided.\n\nLet us break out of that selfish endless loop of repeating mistakes of past generations,\nby working towards a better world a more united world where we recognize each other as One Family.\n\nAnd let us remember that the great and wise beings of past generations,\ndemand that we honor hard won triumphs and do not repeat history's mistakes.\n\nThe very nature of that demand requires that once we take to wisdom,\nwe must stop following orders, and begin thinking, evaluating, and judging for ourselves.\n\nTo honor triumphs and guard against heartbreaking mistakes,\nis the duty we hold to those who came before us,\nand all the future generations that are yet to follow.\n\nAs children we are asked to listen and follow,\nas we grow we must learn to Lead and become Unbreakable.\n\nIt is not just the challenges of life that will test us,\nwe must also think and evaluate and reject that which is wrong.\n\nWe are constantly made to listen and expected to follow,\nlook behind any protest, or scandal, or angry headline.\n\nWe must judge all the contradictory information for ourselves,\nand make an informed decision as to whether or not majority is correct.\n\nLife will always challenge us,\nand My Goodness - times are always changing.\n\nHumanity is constantly bettering her self,\nwhat used to be acceptable - may now, be an affront to justice.\n\nAnd while there isn't enough time to comprehend all the books,\nthere is plenty of time to be come a Loving and Wise Compassionate Human Being,\n\nLet us remember that we are a chain-link between the Hard Work of Past Generations,\nand the United, Free from Poverty, and Peaceful Word of Future Generations.\n\nWe are One Growing Family, and that is the correct context for

If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.\",\nI was as cautions as a cat not to let a day go by withut doing something important.\n\nAnd now I heard a world celebrated Philosopher say the same,\nin a book from 1850, a book written by a man that shared some of his strength with Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nA man I lovingly call Henry,\nI think of him as my friend in time.\n\nHenry David Thoreau is a friend to us all,\nhe used to think about us, about making life better for us, the future generations.\n\nI was at Ambrosia in Ann Arbor,\nThough I wasn't a regular, I spent a lot of time there when it was empty and I could be alone later at night.\n\nI started keeping a folder of ideas and poems,\nI've noticed really beautiful people going to the sports bar next door.\n\nI tried to ignore the song that was playing as it was frightening me,\nthe lyrics rang \"Where'd you get your body from, I got it from my moma.\"\n\nA couple of regulars gathered by and inquired about my paperwork,\nand I thought it was prime time, to tell them word for word.\n\nI begun by reading Kosmos by Walt Whitman,\nI remember finishing with such a flourish that one of my listeners staggered back.\n\nKosmos (Written in 1860 by Walt Whitman)\n\nWho includes diversity and is Nature,\nWho is the amplitude of the earth, and the coarseness and sexuality of the earth, and the great charity of the earth and the equilibrium also,\nWho has not look’d forth from the windows the eyes for nothing, or whose brain held audience with messengers for nothing,\nWho contains believers and disbelievers, who is the most majestic lover,\nWho holds duly his or her triune proportion of realism, spiritualism, and of the æsthetic or intellectual,\nWho having consider’d the body finds all its organs and parts good,\nWho, out of the theory of the earth and of his or her body understands by subtle analogies all other theories,\nThe theory of a city, a poem, and of the large politics of these States;\nWho believes not only in our globe with its sun and moon, but in other globes with their suns and moons,\nWho, constructing the house of himself or herself, not for a day but for all time, sees races, eras, dates, generations,\nThe past, the future, dwelling there, like space, inseparable together.\n\nI actually I had to stop the person from leaving,\n\"One more\" - I asked, nay commanded, demanded, just to share Ayn's Vision of John Galt, and I begun:\n\n\"Your destroyers hold you by means of your endurance, your generosity, your innocence, your love\nthe endurance that carries their burdens\nthe generosity that responds to their cries of despair\nthe innocence that is unable to conceive of their evil and gives them the benefit of every doubt, refusing to condemn them without understanding and incapable of understanding such motives as theirs\nthe love, your love of life, which makes you believe that they are men and that they love it, too.\" (from John Galt's Speech from Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand)\n\nI remember I wasn't able to finish my listeners fidgeted and had to go,\nI didn't belong in Ann Arbor, I didn't really belong at Ambrosia, the truth was I didn't belong anywhere anymore.\n\nI remember someone asking me where I was from, what country;\nand as I rolled up my poems getting ready to leave,\n\n\"I am a Citizen of the World.\" - I said without thinking anything of it.\n\nI remember sitting up one time feeling really alone,\nI think I was headed up to Ludington this time.\n\nAnd time came to listen to Viktor E. Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning,\nbullies came after me when I was a chubby child.\n\nOne year sometime when I was 13 maybe,\nthe little me made the older me make a promise.\n\nI was to return to that damn classrom in my imagination,\nand sit right next to my younger self, and keep him company so that he is not scared anymore.\n\nI kept that promise,\nbut from time to time I also visit Dr. Frankl, I sit by his bed to keep him company too.\n\nThere is a very powerful description of Great Beings in his book,\nit is something that we should each remember.\n\n\"We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others,\ngiving away their last piece of bread.\n\nThey may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing:\nthe last of the human freedoms -- to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.\"\n\nThe book I have read the most times is \"A Short History of Nearly Everything\" by Bill Bryson,\nit is a book that begins with an honest journey to find out more about the world.\n\nIt is very helpful to realize that we don't know all the things we should know,\nand not be ashamed of that, just simply look for some Audio Books on the subject.\n\nI write this in 2020 in the middle of the Pandemic,\nand there is a lot of misled people, people who got taken in by false information.\n\nIn my memory Carl Sagan in his \"The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark\"\nmentions something similar on the subject of Aliens and UFOs.\n\nHe says that there is more beauty and interesting things in the actual Science,\nthan fantasizing stories of visiting aliens and flying saucers.\n\nWhen I was a teenager I was a huge fan of shows like the X-Files,\nand I remember walking into a mighty New York Public Library to crack the case, once and fall all,\n\nNut instead falling in love with Mokele-mbembe, I recognized the creature from my first Science book \"Wszechświat życie człowiek\" published in 1955,\nit was a Brontosaurus, and I instantly fell in love with the idea there there might be a few left in Rhodesia.\n\nFor the world to carry on becoming more and more United,\nwe have to become Great Lovers of Knowledge and take to Books and Audio Books.\n\nThe treasures withing are unlike anything we have heard of in school,\nthe books that we end up loving and carrying with us for the rest of our lives, make us better.\n\nAnd there is never an end to learning for real,\nevery few weeks a new book comes out that you didn't even know you were waiting for.\n\nIt becomes a source of Wisdom, or just sheer joy as the case is with Randall Munroe's\nWhat If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions.\n\nMy Dear Friends, I wish you the discovery of new poems, new quotes,\nnew books and video lectures, authors you will love for live and then some.\n\nAnd don't worry, the world is coming together, the borders are fading, and there is noting that can stop that,\nHumanity is in the process of Unifying to become One Loving Family.\n\nWe can hasten this process by learning, acquiring more knowledge,\npreventing history's mistakes from repeating themselves.\n\nThe path to the future is found In Knowledge and Wisdom,\nand aiming for Greatness of Soul, Heart, and Mind.\n\n\n[Mokele-mbembe]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mokele-mbembe",

business as usual.\n\nWe will learn, we will teach ourselves to become genius,\nthe easy-peasy way, by going on long adventures with a bunch of wise non-fiction books.\n\nWhen our planet comes under attack, it will not perish,\nfor it holds a species of animal that can perceive it self, alter, and rise to heights unseen.\n\nAll it takes,\nis for us to notice, that something is wrong.\n\nPerhaps, taking it easy, would be OK,\nif you were not capable, of becoming a Great Being.\nif you were not a Genius, and a Powerful Thinker.\n\nIf you were unable to rise, to Inspire Generations,\nto save the Planet for all the Children yet to be born,\nand to repair schools so that they help humanity progress.\n\nBut ultimately taking it easy, can't be OK,\nbecause that would disappoint the one person that truly does have all the authority over you,\nthat you really do not want to disappoint, in any way.\n\nYour Elder Self...\n\nYour elder self, will be incredibly disappointed in you,\nif you fail to quickly shed all the stupid things sneaked into you by mis-education and questionable culture.\n\nYour elder self, will be incredibly disappointed in you,\nif you fail to learn to unfold your wings as a genius, and an intellectual.\n\nYour elder self, will be incredibly disappointed in you,\nif you fail to rise out of loneliness and isolation.\n\nYour elder self, will be seriously pissed off,\nif you mess this up.\n\nYour elder self will know exactly who you could have become,\nand where you made the wrong decisions that prevented you from becoming the person that they wish to be.\n\nMy Friends,\nI wish there was more I could to to help you believe that you are each a genius.\n\nBut I can only give you the books.\n\nI can't put the ear-buds in your ears and press play,\nbecause to hear the books you have to slow down in life,\nyou have to begin questioning the things that were driving you,\nand you have to become ready to listen,\nand by that time you can press play on your own.\n\nA genius is not an intellectual anomaly,\neven Savants spend years mastering their tricks.\n\nWe are all capable of gaining Powerful Intelligence,\nand we don't need schools for that,\njust a mountain of down to earth books made heavy with lifetimes of wisdom.\n\nYou don't need to memorize Mathematical Formulas,\nand the last place you want to learn about Biology, is Biology.\n\nWhat you need is stories that teach you about the reasons behind the invention of mathematics,\nand and an adventure where you re-invent mathematics from scratch, with the fantastic and magical ability to look some stuff up along the way.\n\nYou don't need to learn about the powerhouse of the cell,\nyou need to begin with Stromatolites, Panspermia, Evolution and Astrobiology.\nMitochondria used to be a separate organism, what an adventure to follow, what an honor to make new discoveries on that path.\n\nMy Friends,\n\nYou must begin your education by pushing everything that interferes with your Natural Genius away,\neven if it is the city you live in, or school you are forced to go to.\n\nAnd you must begin your life, knowing that you are a Powerful Genius,\nin dire need for more books and audio books that will fuel your Wisdom.\n\nAs I write this,\nthere are only 3,900 tigers left.\n\nPlease, believe in your genius, and grow, my friend,\nit is not just the tigers that need help,\nthe task at hand if far greater.\n\nWith ten million people in cages around the word,\nwe have to help children and students of today,\nout of poverty, and towards real education,\nso that they may have a chance at a fair start in life.",

we may turn around and begin moving in the opposite one.\n\nThe more we know, the better we navigate,\na powerful intermediate solution to this problem is Non-Fiction Audio Books,\nMemoirs and Biographies about Growing Up and Learning.\n\nThe Problem of Content of Culture, more specifically Cultural Indoctrination.\n\nIs in observations of the surrounding world,\nand hopes of living a meaningful existence in harmony with it.\n\nIf we are taught a falsehood about the world,\nwe will make decisions, of our own free will, that will be wrong.\n\nA good example of that is the propaganda of warring tribes or nations,\nteaching their children that the other is evil.\n\nIt is very difficult to catch ourselves as being under control of a cultural falsehood,\nwe tend to accept the culture we are born into, as a source of absolute truth.\n\nLet me give you an example,\nthat your mind will actively work to reject, paragraph by paragraph.\n\nWhen we went to school we were convinced it would teach us knowledge,\neven though nearly every month there was more and more evidence to the contrary.\n\nNo matter what,\nwe still believed.\n\nWe saw unfair grading, bullies and violence, hate, racism and indifference,\nwe saw that everyone was cheating by cramming, and that teachers loved it.\n\nWe saw many kids get into drugs and alcohol,\nsome of us even foresaw that some of the staff were predators looking for prey.\n\nWe accepted grades,\nand we accepted it as a measure of our intelligence.\n\nWe accepted grades, knowing about cheating by cramming, and knowing about unfair grading,\nwe still though of ourselves as B or C, or D level humans.\n\nIn the end we saw, that everything we gained, we gained by working on our own,\nand finally noticed that a diploma didn't even guarantee a well-paying job.\n\nLate on in life many of us noticed that many schools are not a source of knowledge,\nbut a source of regret, a force of erosion.\n\nMany of us became so confused, that we immediately assumed we were wrong,\nand never said a single bad thing about schools.\n\nThe tragedy of organized education,\nis a good example of the Overwhelming Power of Cultural Indoctrination.\n\nNow let us take a look at Authenticity and Pursuits of Excellence with a bit more detail, as those two combine to help with both\nThe Problem of Knowing Enough and The Problem of Cultural Indoctrination.\n\nAuthenticity.\n\nAccept authenticity the way you accepted Dignity, and Goodness, and Class.\nthat's how you become more sensitive to inconsistencies that are surrounding you.\n\nNext time you ask yourself, am I classy, and I a good person, am I a dignified person,\nalso ask; am I an authentic person that lives an authentic existence.\n\nDignity, and Goodness, and Class, are things we strengthen in our Soul and Heart as we grow,\nnow add Authenticity to help you see a little bit better.\n\nOften times when our intent is noble, but results end up wrong,\nit means that we were purposefully misled.\n\nWith Authenticity in our Heart,\nwe get an extra moment to ourselves.\n\nIn context of education, if a teacher is forcing you to cram for tests so you get good grades,\nyou are more likely to walk out and talk to the Dean, or Principal.\n\nNo longer will you feel compelled to cram,\nbecause it will feel inauthentic.\n\nAfter all, faking test results by means of cramming, or temporary memorization,\nis not what you intended when signing up for school, it is something you were pressured into.\n\nAuthenticity presents many more challenges in life than just going along with everyone else,\nbecause one of the strong points of moving along with the surrounding culture, is that it is easier to move with the flow and play by the rules.\n\nHowever, the price we pay for ease,\nis that we don't really learn anything, we just pretend to learn.\n\nPursuits of Excellence are by definition difficult, and challenging, however they result in Real Knowledge, a Real Functional Education.\nYou start with Audio Books, Video Lectures, Survey Courses and learn with whatever means are at your disposal.\n\nThis is more challenging, than cramming for tests,\nbut this is not difficult because you are working with material you love, with knowledge that touches and moves you.\n\nThe reward for Standing in Relentless Pursuit of Excellence and Authentic Achievement,\nis the Complete Knowledge of the subject you Love.\n\nIf that takes you to a Science, Medical, Technology or Engineering School,\nor a Startup Accelerator, or your own company from zero.\n\nThen you are faced with a much smaller challenge, there is no more cramming, or pretending,\nas you are now filled with Athletic Knowledge from across thousands of books.\n\nKnowledge that you connected in a sequence that served you best,\nand at a pace that helped you retain most.\n\nAuthenticity and Pursuits of Excellence,\nput us on a path to becoming Wiser Beings.\n\nThey will help you see in a world obscured by indoctrination,\nor one that lacks real education.\n\n\n[tragedy of organized education]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCbdS4hSa0s\n[Startup Accelerator]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=What+is+a+Startup+Accelerator",

G. Wells, Mark Twain, Mary Shelley, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.\n\n...And uhh... you know, (and this is just between you and me),\nyou could uhh... spice up the slower, dryer parts of said books.\n\nYou know, mistakes happen, you could for example mix up Mary Shelley's Frankenstein\nwith H. G.

      "text": "It started Christmas 2020, the world was already in trouble;\nthe conjecture in a sentence was this:\n\n\"What can be corrupted will be corrupted, and there are no fully operational public institutions anywhere\",\nit is too easy for bad people to, not just subvert, but erase lifetimes of hard work and dedication.\n\nIt is commonly known as corruption, but that didn't matter to them,\nbecause they were not attempting to fix things, they had an idea how to replace everything.\n\nAnd by everything,\nthey meant institutions all around the world.\n\nThey were going to begin in the beginning, Henry Ford once said,\n\"If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.\",\n\nThe idea was that if they went to the Courts, Police or Schools,\nthey would have wanted the wrong things, that would only invite more problems.\n\nInitially nobody knew how immune to corruption the thing was going to be,\nbut there was a way to find out.\n\nThe thing was a game, it was meant to be a simulation of a city,\nit was a simple program that used simple web design principles to simulate a city.\n\nThe non playable characters, were little bots that would interact with the player,\nthe bots were crafted to simulate officials, and they interacted with web pages the way a user would.\n\nSo part of the reason why the programming was so simple,\nis that bots needed a simple way to pretend to be humans.\n\nWhen everything went online players would sign up to take over for the bots,\nand some of the initial testing was about corrupting the institutions of the city.\n\nThe thinking was that, if it was not possible for players to corrupt an institution,\nthen the program could replace all the management software of a real city.\n\nTo their surprise there was a number of cities that were willing to participate in the trials,\nit took them a better part of a decade to get everything going, but the initial trials worked.\n\nThey knew that they became famous,\nwhen the UN wouldn't stop calling.\n\nIt worked because they kept insisting on simplicity,\nthey kept using bots, and corruption simulation teams for decades.\n\nThe program was adopted by almost all the cities of the world,\nabout 10,000 running copies.\n\nWhat was fascinating about this,\nis that it was still played as a game.\n\nThere was a Virtual Cyberpunk City,\nthat everyone went to for internet news.\n\nThe program relies on plain HTTP, REST, and HTML\nand to make it operate well on $30 Android Tablets it uses little client-side scripting.\n\nIt is a Virtual City at heart,\nbut when players start mapping out real homes, and roads, and the citizens join in,\nit inflates to become a virtual representation of a real city.\n\nPeople can vote in elections, and there is no real threat of corruption here,\nbecause their voting history is under their profile.\n\nElections, that was one of the things that got a huge upgrade in many of the cities around the world,\nsome cities just vote on ideas that need to get done, they don't vote on representatives anymore.\n\nThe program as a whole,\neliminated the need for representatives.\n\nPeople vote on issues that need immediate attention,\nand those are the first issues that get solved.\n\nTwo amazing things emerged from within the program,\nschools begun working for the students by providing them with Audio Books, Lectures, and Chat (that's what the teachers are called),\nand the trail of programs that students select over the course of their teenage years actually becomes their resume.\n\nSchools started working,\nit was Rebirth and Enlightenment of both the citizens and the cities.\n\nThe second,\npeople could work on tasks logged by the users of the program.\n\nSome tasks like taking care of public gardens could result in users getting monthly tips from their community,\npeople loved being able to give the lady down the street $8/mo. for making sure all the flower beds were taken care of,\nthe lady next door was often bringing in $3,200 per month for something that she would do anyway, people loved her.\n\nOther tasks like road work, could get a bounty, bounties basically ensured that all the road work was done,\nany competent company could claim a task and grab the bounty for a pothole.\n\nPeople would setup an tiny Limited Liability Company and stock up on compatible materials, and wait for roadwork tasks,\nthere were no more delays to get things done, and these bounties could grow fast.\n\nAll this was tested in the games before cities adopted the program,\nso everyone knew what they were getting, and the stuff just worked.\n\nThere was an interesting phenomenon where automated programs would actually stay in place of people,\none of the most well know instances dealt with the prison population, in a small Swiss city.\n\nThe entire process was often ran by bots,\ncity was able to vote on presets, this eliminated the need for many local Judges.\n\nIn this particular instance all the folks who got into fights,\nwere automatically given community service, duration of which would increase with each repeated offense under the same category,\nthe community service program was actually a well paying program, the users didn't want people to go to jail,\nthey wanted the troublemakers to get a job.\n\nWords like felon and criminal were not used, people in the community had access to their entire education,\nthey could see into hearts and souls of these users, the books, pursuits, and curiosities of their teenage years were right there.\n\nPsychologists were able to build up a new spectrum disorder, that emerged from stress, loss, fear, isolation.\n\nThe Swiss town actually ended up closing most of it's prisons.\n\nIn America, a similar system of automated programs resulted in a lot of convictions being overturned.\n\nThis was a prison management system where the inmates were able to present their case in a way that the citizens would understand from a more humane perspective,\nagain the entire past of that person was right there, tragedies and loss, and stress would be followed by more misfortune, deteriorating mental condition, desperate self medication\nto get back to a thinking state, and what was once called a Felon or Criminal, once again became a Human, a Brother, a Son, a Daughter, a Mother.\n\nPrison population dropped.\n\nNobody called this program a game,\nit was always meant to change the world.\n\nThe cities were always connected together to form a larger Global Metropolis,\noriginally it helped people with jobs, as users could tell where they could find tasks that fit them best,\n\nBut now, decades after the initial release;\nthe program begun uniting the world.\n\nWar, for one became unthinkable,\nas people could see how the well being of even one city affected all the others.\n\nThere was no such thing as not having a job,\nthe cities always needed help with countless tasks.\n\nCorruption had nowhere to hide, the crooked politicians had nowhere to hide,\nnational borders made little economic sense, and Climate Change stopped being an issue by 2030.\n\nNot that they cared for rewards, but The Women behind the program,\nthe original programmers, received Purple Hearts and multiple Nobel Peace Prizes.\n\nWhat they did love was the fact that the United Nations regained a certain vitality,\nsomething that they discovered was once lost in the translation.\n\nEvery city now has a sculpture to honor them.\nMany of their sculptures bear the words they uttered so many times during the initial development, \"Faster Horses\".\n\nIn closing, the conjecture was true.\nIn the haste of life, people, often out of desperation, will try to meet goals by exploiting systems without active countermeasures.\nThe only system that can resist corruption and exploitation, is one designed from ground up to resist it.\n\nIt takes a computer to create a a corruption-resistant scaffold around the matters of a city.\nWhere there is no room for stretching rules, the participants can only be encouraged to take the correct paths.",

operate well on $30 Android Tablets it uses little client-side scripting.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is a Virtual City at heart,</p>\n  <p>but when players start mapping out real homes, and roads, and the citizens join in,</p>\n  <p>it inflates to become a virtual representation of a real city.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>People can vote in elections, and there is no real threat of corruption here,</p>\n  <p>because their voting history is under their profile.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Elections, that was one of the things that got a huge upgrade in many of the cities around the world,</p>\n  <p>some cities just vote on ideas that need to get done, they don&apos;t vote on representatives anymore.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The program as a whole,</p>\n  <p>eliminated the need for representatives.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>People vote on issues that need immediate attention,</p>\n  <p>and those are the first issues that get solved.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Two amazing things emerged from within the program,</p>\n  <p>schools begun working for the students by providing them with Audio Books, Lectures, and Chat (that&apos;s what the teachers are called),</p>\n  <p>and the trail of programs that students select over the course of their teenage years actually becomes their resume.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Schools started working,</p>\n  <p>it was Rebirth and Enlightenment of both the citizens and the cities.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The second,</p>\n  <p>people could work on tasks logged by the users of the program.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Some tasks like taking care of public gardens could result in users getting monthly tips from their community,</p>\n  <p>people loved being able to give the lady down the street $8/mo. for making sure all the flower beds were taken care of,</p>\n  <p>the lady next door was often bringing in $3,200 per month for something that she would do anyway, people loved her.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Other tasks like road work, could get a bounty, bounties basically ensured that all the road work was done,</p>\n  <p>any competent company could claim a task and grab the bounty for a pothole.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>People would setup an tiny Limited Liability Company and stock up on compatible materials, and wait for roadwork tasks,</p>\n  <p>there were no more delays to get things done, and these bounties could grow fast.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>All this was tested in the games before cities adopted the program,</p>\n  <p>so everyone knew what they were getting, and the stuff just worked.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>There was an interesting phenomenon where automated programs would actually stay in place of people,</p>\n  <p>one of the most well know instances dealt with the prison population, in a small Swiss city.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The entire process was often ran by bots,</p>\n  <p>city was able to vote on presets, this eliminated the need for many local Judges.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In this particular instance all the folks who got into fights,</p>\n  <p>were automatically given community service, duration of which would increase with each repeated offense under the same category,</p>\n  <p>the community service program was actually a well paying program, the users didn&apos;t want people to go to jail,</p>\n  <p>they wanted the troublemakers to get a job.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Words like felon and criminal were not used, people in the community had access to their entire education,</p>\n  <p>they could see into hearts and souls of these users, the books, pursuits, and curiosities of their teenage years were right there.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Psychologists were able to build up a new spectrum disorder, that emerged from stress, loss, fear, isolation.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The Swiss town actually ended up closing most of it&apos;s prisons.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In America, a similar system of automated programs resulted in a lot of convictions being overturned.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>\n    This was a prison management system where the inmates were able to present their case in a way that the citizens would understand from a more humane perspective,</p>\n  again the entire past of that person was right there, tragedies and loss, and stress would be followed by more misfortune, deteriorating mental condition, desperate self medication\n  to get back to a thinking state, and what was once called a Felon or Criminal, once again became a Human, a Brother, a Son, a Daughter, a Mother.<p></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Prison population dropped.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Nobody called this program a game,</p>\n  <p>it was always meant to change the world.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The cities were always connected together to form a larger Global Metropolis,</p>\n  <p>originally it helped people with jobs, as users could tell where they could find tasks that fit them best,</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But now, decades after the initial release;</p>\n  <p>the program begun uniting the world.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>War, for one became unthinkable,</p>\n  <p>as people could see how the well being of even one city affected all the others.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>There was no such thing as not having a job,</p>\n  <p>the cities always needed help with countless tasks.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Corruption had nowhere to hide, the crooked politicians had nowhere to hide,</p>\n  <p>national borders made little economic sense, and Climate Change stopped being an issue by 2030.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Not that they cared for rewards, but The Women behind the program,</p>\n  <p>the original programmers, received Purple Hearts and multiple Nobel Peace Prizes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>What they did love was the fact that the United Nations regained a certain vitality,</p>\n  <p>something that they discovered was once lost in the translation.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Every city now has a sculpture to honor them.</p>\n  <p>Many of their sculptures bear the words they uttered so many times during the initial development, &quot;Faster Horses&quot;.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In closing, the conjecture was true.</p>\n  <p>In the haste of life, people, often out of desperation, will try to meet goals by exploiting systems without active countermeasures.</p>\n  <p>The only system that can resist corruption and exploitation, is one designed from ground up to resist it.</p>\n  <p>\n  </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It takes a computer to create a a corruption-resistant scaffold around the matters of a city.</p>\n  <p>Where there is no room for stretching rules, the participants can only be encouraged to take the correct paths.</p>\n</div>",

only had a blank page for an imaginary city.\n\nAdding user support had to come in next,\njust like every city had a page, so did every user.\n\nThus, Night City would receive its first two citizens,\nAlice and Bob.\n\nOut in the server room the admin was already preparing for corruption simulations,\nand she named the malicious politician Mallory.\n\nAlice and Bob represented computer

working on the system fun.\n\nBut by far the most special thing about bots,\nwas that they could be replaced by a real human,\nby a person that would turn off the bot and log in into their

account,\nthey could go to a local store and buy and deliver the groceries for a small payment.\n\nEven in the early tests, it was becoming more an more obvious,\nthat a powerful automated framework that could help people make money could be built.\n\nAs with every program the girls were worried about its adoption,\nbut it was universally agreed that people would join to make money,\nand in the end large cities would go online within weeks,\nbecause it helped people put food on the table by trading small services.\n\nCosmopolis 2.0 was what got the attention of United Nations,\nbut that is a story for another time.\n\nPersonal Note,\n\nBecoming a programmer is not that hard, and when you have a dream like our story of Cosmopolis here,\nit becomes a fun hobby that you just aimlessly poke at when there is some time in a day.\n\nThere is a tradition of creating Programming Cook-books, they are books tailored for a specific language,\nthat contain short recipes, and it is really fun to

of Nuclear War,\nthe models predicted the war as 100% certain.\n\nThis is what happens, when one generation passes onto the next,\nMutually Assured Destruction.\n\nIt didn't take computer models,\nit didn't require an imagination,\nwar only needs time, guns and borders.\n\nFor uneducated humans, war is a certainty,\nwar is where we all come from.\n\nThe models predicted that it would take decades,\nnearly a century to reach a stable disarmament.\n\nOne of the greatest problems that Humanity faces is born of group cohesion,\nwhen we lived in tribes automatic self-indoctrination ensured tribe stability.\n\nWhen the world connected,\naccepting the cultures and beliefs of the local group we were born into, divided us from the rest creating a border.\n\nThe threat of nuclear war grew, and it was not disarmament,\nbut leaving all the bad ideas behind, that would make all the difference.\n\nAbandoning invisible indoctrination and leaving imperceptibly-bad ideas behind,\ncan only occur on generation by generation level.\n\nThe generations with cultures holding bad ideas needed to retire out of old age,\nand a more realistic, more educated, wiser and humane culture, was to take over.\n\nNo abrupt changes could be made without conflict,\nout of love for all Life and Humanity this was the first project to require over a hundred years of work.\n\nAnd so sweetly, one of the girls said, that this would require the work of a League,\nThe League of Extraordinary Ladies, another one jokingly proclaimed in a grumbly tone.\n\nAnd the Universe,\ndid smile.\n\nThe models revealed that Political Borders and Nationalism in a Nation armed with Nuclear Weapons,\nwould result in a high probability of a Nuclear War, as each generation is indoctrinated into the worst ideas of the previous.\n\nThe most terrifying model prediction was that as more and more got lost in translation between consecutive generations,\nthe probability of nuclear war approached 100%.\n\nAnd as all Heroines do, The League of Extraordinary Ladies,\nset off on a multi-generational promise, to save the world.\n\nThe weakness, of the ease with which we accept the culture we are born into as true and perfect,\nwas going to be addressed by a novel educational program creatively named the Global Progressive Advancement (GPA).\n\nVolunteers would create free, open, unbranded, library of audio books out of works in public domain,\nand the website would stitch these works together into Audio Lectures with the aid of speakers, poets and teachers.\n\nCelebrities, well known authors, and even movie stars would contribute their time, voice and patience,\nto create what became the greatest work of art, that by far exceeded even the most romantic descriptions of the Library of Alexandria.\n\nA number of authors donated their works to the school,\nstudents participating in the free self-paced open-curriculum school had access to Carl Sagan, Bill Bryson, Neil deGrasse Tyson, and pretty much all the others.\n\nBy 2050, it was the only school taken seriously,\nbecause it was the only school that resulted in students showing great results.\n\nThe school brought the world together in Knowledge and Wisdom,\nand as predicted in less than a 150 years from the initial inception, the borders fell.\n\nA new, and more informed, nuclear disarmament program was born,\nthat decades after resulted in cessation of weapons manufacturing of all kind throughout Europe and Asia.\n\nThese seemingly fantastic, impossible goals of world peace,\nwere achieved by helping Humanity converge on wisdom by means of books made more accessible by narrators.\n\nProviding superior education to the children of a nation,\nwhilst letting their parents live out culture they were born into,\nis a form of Infinite Kindness, it is a form of Love.\n\nRather than the children inheriting just the culture of their parents and the nation they were born to,\nby participating in the Global Progressive Advancement program, they also inherited the best ideas and wisdom from Humanity's most beloved books.\n\nWorld Peace was reached by taking advantage of our susceptibility to cultural indoctrination,\nto blindly and without a question accepting ideas of the world we are born into,\nthis was not a trick, but much needed medicine and vaccine that prevented mutually assured destruction.\n\nWe simply added Knowledge and Wisdom,\nto the culture and spirit of times, to all the nations.\n\nThe first and foremost force of the educational program was not knowledge,\nit was Reality, something that corruption and decay is incapable of using for its advantage.\n\nThe reality of the human condition is that we all yearn for wisdom,\nand meaning, and love, and kinship and belonging.\n\nIt mattered not if it was two boys that Father Gregory Boyle was raising,\nor two nations that hated each other in starvation for wisdom.\n\nOnce they had access to wisdom,\nreality helped to unravel their misunderstandings and helped them grow.\n\nThe League of Extraordinary Ladies didn't stop at Nuclear Disarmament,\ntheir granddaughters ended poverty.\n\nThey did so by, now the age old tradition of using weakness to fight weakness,\nthey ended poverty by means of poverty.\n\nIt was a micro management, and micro payment transaction platform,\ndistributed on smart tablets that helped communities of the world trade services.\n\nThe adoption of the platform was hastened by the fact that no money was made from these transactions by the hosting company,\nif someone needed a car ride, or grocery delivery, housework, or a tutor to help their kids with math, there was always someone ten minutes away that would help.\n\nOne of the untended features of this program was local pantry,\na feature originally intended for trading foodstuffs, that later became a place to feed the hungry.\n\nThe trading platform also helped to place the homeless in unused hotels and apartments,\nin such a way that they had easy access to care takers, teachers, therapists and a chance at a better future.\n\nIt is hard to say what prevented Humanity as a whole from coming together like these friends did,\nbut it is easy to see that it was internet that helped communities collaborate and communicate better.\n\nWe needed programs to help us talk to each other,\nand cut out the middle men.\n\nWe needed programs that helped cities become more independent,\nand stop relying on the state and nation that by contrast meant little.\n\nAnd we needed to begin thinking in decades,\nin centuries.\n\nBecause our problems, do not end with us,\nand what we leave behind is easily misunderstood.\n\nWhat was originally created as a deterrent, come future, in chaos, in poverty, in haste,\ngiven all that is lost in translation, will eventually become the tool that it really is.\n\n\n[Father Gregory Boyle]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipR0kWt1Fkc",

the power.\n\nTo get inside it,\nyou use a remote terminal.\n\nOnce you login,\nyou get a command prompt.\n\nIt listens to words, to commands,\nvery similar to adventure games.\n\nIndeed, directories on your hard-drive,\nare very much like rooms in a game.\n\nTo get inside Documents,\ntype in \"cd Documents\"\n\nThe command \"cd\" is short for,\nChange Directory, a Directory is the same as a folder on windows.\n\nWhen you say \"cd Documents\",\nyou are giving the cd command an argument, or an option, or a setting, or a preference.\n\nThe cd command is a perfect example of how command line interfaces should work,\njust a couple of words and nothing more.\n\nBut sometimes, that is not enough,\nlike for example when you want to ask \"cd\" for help.\n\nWe can't say \"cd help\" becasue then the cd command would search for a directory named help,\nwe have to make the second word special, to do that you use hyphens.\n\nYou can type in \"cd --help\",\nit will notice the hyphens, and print out some helpful information.\n\nTo see what is in a directory, type in \"ls\",\nwhich is short for list, or list files.\n\n\"ls\" also accepts special inputs,\nyou can ask it for help like above.\n\nBut also ask it to list files in a long format,\nby saying \"ls -l\" here we use a singe hyphen, because \"-l\" is commonly used,\nthe -l is short for \"--long-listing\", but nobody bothers spelling that out.\n\nTo list files with readable file sizes,\nyou have to add -h, here -h has long form, and some people may use spell it out as \"--human-readable\"\n\nUsually when writing complex commands that other people will use,\nthe long form is preferred, bu when you are just typing on the command line and want to do something quickly,\nyou just use the short versions.\n\nThe command line interface is trying to be your friend,\nit wants to function with just one or two words, but it also some with extras like the --human-readable flag.\n\nThere are many tutorials on how to use the command line,\nand many books, my favorite are the pocket books, take a look at O'Reilly Bash Pocket Reference\n\nHere are instructions on how to play audio through HDMI,\nyour monitor should have an audio out somewhere.\n\nNow see if you can get that GPIO header soldered on,\nand try to blink some of the RGB LED HAT lights based on this tutorial.\n\nAlternatively you can just blink a simple LED based on this instructable,\nnote that a standard Raspberry PI 4 8GB comes with the header soldered on to make things easier.\n\nAnd there is also a Raspberry PI WH,\nmeaning Wireless with Headers pre-soldered.\n\nAnd now, get a $10 camera,\nand use raspistill to take a photo,\nand play around with all the other options.\n\nNow you have an inexpensive platform for your inventions,\na programmable machine, that you access over the radio of your wireless network.\n\nYou can make it blink, or take time-lapse photographs of the next snow storm,\nyou can get an LCD screen and turn it into a tablet.\n\nRaspberry PI is not the only Single-board computer,\nPINE looks really nice as well.\n\nIf you are looking for a more complicated project,\nperhaps try building a Raspberry PI Drone,\nbonus if you can get it to cross the Atlantic.\n\nWe have no limits,\nbut we are also very unique.\n\nOur inventions need not rely on commuters,\nsome of the greatest inventions the Human Kind has seen, were just ideas.\n\nDon't let anybody stop you from inventing,\nand don't stop dreaming.\n\nFinally, the most impractical and outrageous inventions,\nmake for the most magnificent Videos, White Papers, CVs, and Resumes.\n\nAim,\nfor the Moon.\n\n\n[Seth Shostak]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_udY35m3SdE\n[4 x 8 RGB LED HAT]:

      "text": "Fake schooling and the resulting lack of education,\nnot only hold us back and propagate misery but will destabilize a nation.\n\nBut the problems are far more complicated,\nfor one there are very few real criminals, most were just warped by lack of school.\n\nReal schools, have the ability,\nto prevent a person from committing a crime.\n\nOn top of that, upon committing a crime,\nif prisons were turned to special need schools, we could help almost everyone.\n\nReal schools are not that complex,\nplus they can use poverty to their advantage.\n\nBy presenting students with a way out of poverty that fits them,\nthe students will be put in a position where they will want to learn particular things.\n\nThat's how real education works,\nit is not about tests an memorization, but need, imagination, triumph and challenge.\n\nBe it a misguided voter, a desperate student, or someone blinded by fear and anger and poverty,\nschools are all there really is, it is the greatest hope and dream.\n\nWhat we call a school today, is not a school,\nit is a collective fantasy that hands the teachers a paycheck, and the students a diploma.\n\nOur cognitive biases make it so that we go along with it,\nthere are people out there who hold up a diploma they crammed for and truly believe they are an engineer.\n\nThis is probably similar to when a person commits a crime,\nthey say \"This is is this is where I finally become free\", but that is only cartoon reality.\n\nA college diploma does not mean that the student is educated,\nand when deans are pressed they will say, \"We discouraged cramming\".\n\nAnd when everyone is pressed to own up,\nthe mother of the boy who stole,\nthe engineer's professor,\nand the engineer and the student,\nand that so called criminal,\n\nthe men who approve textbooks,\nthose who pray to fairy-tales in hopes of saving nations they mistakenly destroyed,\n\nand the prime ministers, and royalty,\npopes and cardinals,\nand the congresses, and the president,\n\nand the men who nearly destroyed this nation by the practice of \"enhanced interrogation\",\nand those who ignored climate change and might have done a lot worse than torture,\n\nand those who are glad, that we all forgot,\nthat we have all pointed intercontinental ballistic missiles at each other,\nall the major cities, all of them, every family, every future.\n\nAll they will say is this:\n\n\"I was JUST following orders.\"\n\n\"I JUST didn't know.\"\n\n\"HOW was I supposed to know?\"\n\nThis is what fake education results in,\nthis is the \"fake it until you make it\" pattern of behavior.\n\nThe solution to it all is books,\nbooks that those of us who are good at narration,\nread for others who aren't very good at reading.\n\nTeams of students, ganging up together to record books, with laughter, and foolishness,\nand dammit, sometimes adding whole new chunks to them, to make the dry parts more interesting.\n\nAnd sharing, with everyone,\neverywhere.\n\nLaughter is the ultimate seal of authenticity,\nthat something is worth our time.\n\nOnce the world awakens to the realization that students should make the lectures,\ndriving them with collective curiosities and inspirations, and sharing them for free.\n\nKids will want to watch them,\nthey will want to see what happens next.\n\nCan you imagine a set of lectures by students working to bring back Pixel Art Games,\nlectures on the subject of Color Theory, Trigonometry, Calculus, Music Composition, and even woodworking for the arcade cabinets.\n\nCan you see what having that full vision do to a young mind,\nhow inspiring it is to see the classroom succeed in turning out, one game after another, and making a pretty penny too.\n\nReal schools combine with reality,\nthey are both an introduction to the real world and a future extension of it.\n\nI know that all of this is a lot to take in,\nit is a description of the biggest of our problems,\nand the middle of our solutions.\n\nThe beginning is much simpler than that,\nthe beginning starts off like every superhero origin story ever told.\n\nYou build up your power,\nyou armor.\n\nYou pick up your first book, your second book, your third book,\nMetamorphosis, Walden, Cosmos, Into The Wild.\n\nSagan, Bryson, Thoreau, Kafaka, Krakauer, Kant, Nietzche,\nDawkins, Harris, Hitchens, Dennett, and countelss others.\n\nWith each book you hear, you inherit you inherit the wisdom of the author,\njust like that, straight up data transfer,\nand re-listening to the same audio books or lectures makes them even more powerful.\n\nIt takes a few years to take it all on,\nbut before you know it, your own idea synthesis kicks in.\n\nYou'll be able to feel the world,\nand feel the fear of the fakers, and pretenders.\n\nYou'll be able to see the paths of change,\nthat the world needs so that it may continue growing.\n\nYou'll be able to connect, restore, repair, and

confused adults, lost and looking for belonging.\n\nWhy is this tolerated?\n\nLet me ask you,\nwhat would happen if we asked all the College Graduates to re-take all their tests from high school on?\n\nShouldn't people who graduated college easily show improvement to their GPA when re-taking all their tests?\n\nShouldn't those who graduated, but can't pass their test,\nask for a refund, or a lawsuit for having been tricked into an impression of education?\n\nIt is tolerance of these simple stupid problems,\nthat leads to made up lives of fantasy and eventual blindness towards evil.\n\nIf you can't pass all the college tests and get a higher GPA than that with which you graduated college,\nthen you do not have a college education.\n\nIf you can't pass all the high school tests and get a higher GPA than that with which you graduated high school with,\nthen you do not have a high school education.\n\nIf you can't pass all the middle school tests and get a higher GPA than the one you left middle school with,\nthen you do not have a middle school education.\n\nNot only that, but the way these schools teach and the knowledge they drive into you,\nmay not be useful; you may not even have a useful education.\n\nI think we can all agree here,\nthat we have a problem.\n\nAt the very least,\nif your child has bad grades, don't make them feel bad, or unintelligent.\n\nYou should move them to a different type of school,\nwhere teachers are interested in educated children rather than turning them into a paycheck.\n\nThe reason why it does not occur to parents that schools are not working,\nis that they don't have experience with fake institutions, they take them for granted.\n\nThey are indoctrinated into a culture where school is good,\nand being a worker is great, and it takes a particularly awful person not to achieve anything in life.\n\nSo what are those achievements?\n\nHow is all that retesting going?\n\nThe problem, as you can imagine, is much larger,\ntolerance of fake education is just the beginning.\n\nAbove all,\nHumanity must grow.\n\nWe are not allowed to tolerate Human Right Violations,\nall human beings are created equal.\n\nAll must be granted equal opportunity to real education,\nin a world that sets them free from poverty, and helps their bodies stay healthy.\n\nNations are not allowed to oppress their people,\nno one has that right.\n\nNations have a great responsibility to help them to a Real Education,\nin ways that will ignite a life long adventure across all sciences.\n\nAn opinion cannot stand against a fact,\nthat is a sign of illness, a small disorder born from fake-education.\n\nAnd our dignity is such, that we must help each other rise,\nwe are not to tolerate anything that tricks people into believing in options over facts.\n\nFake education has been behind every evil perpetrated on this planet,\nit is very much like a virus, it does two things really well, it spreads, and it reinfects.\n\nWhatever beliefs are too hard to let go of,\nwe only need to place them in history or fantasy books.\n\nIt is wonderful to ponder Ice Giants and Greats Serpents,\nbut only as a fairy tale, or part of our growing up, not as a fact of life.\n\nFake education, unravels us,\nit erases great strides made by great beings, and pulls the younger generations into dark ages.\n\nThe fantasies that bring us calm,\nunravel the minds of the younger generations.\n\nThe reason we search for mere calm,\nis that we ourselves, have been tricked out of real education.\n\nAll these confusing questions,\nare easily treated with made up fantasies.\n\nBut that also serves to defeat the purpose,\nof having a Beautiful and Powerful Mind.\n\nIt makes us weak.\n\nNot a single Human Being is allowed tolerate\nConcentration Camps, Abuse, Child Abuse, Racism and Xenophobia, or Inequality, Hate, or Fake Education.\n\nThose of us who chose to relegate ourselves to a life of fantasy,\nmust also leave the table of public discourse.\n\nThose of us who trade with nations that employ torture,\nare not allowed to hold political positions, they simply can't, it is immoral to tolerate this.\n\nAnybody who is delays Humanity's Progress,\ncontributes to Human Suffering, to all Suffering, Blindness, Misery, War, and Torture.\n\nOur minds are extremely powerful,\nand as they are allowed to develop, we will find unity.\n\nWe will agree on everything,\nas we stabilize amongst each other in wisdom.\n\nGovernment wise, there are no great disagreements,\nthere is only steady progress, forward.\n\nOn the individual level,\nit is not that different.\n\nStress and anger, and sadness yield to Love and Wisdom,\neven tragedy turns around a little bit.\n\nWith real education, we don't fall to pieces because something beautiful ended,\nbut we celebrate that it existed in the first place.\n\nIn wisdom, we seek a different class of things,\nNobler Things that come about as a result of our sense of dignity and real education.\n\nNo longer does anyone go home to a TV dinner,\nsuffering from depression, and fear, and loneliness.\n\nWhat creates an educated government, a real government,\nis prevention of sickness and poverty.\n\nNobody goes home convinced they are a worker,\nor terrified of Human Resources, or or an uneducated \"Boss\".\n\nThere isn't anybody who will argue against free medical care,\nor universal income, or national debt, let it pile up.\n\nThe greater the debt that nations of earth owe to the universe,\nthe higher our level of compassion, empathy and development.\n\nMoney is just a job tracking tool,\non the government level it exists as an abstract idea.\n\nYou don't have to worry about Government Debt,\nit is a good kind of debt, and it has no collectors.\n\nDo you see?\n\nFake Education,\nis tearing this world apart.\n\nFake Education,\nis halting its progress.\n\nIt is neutering our minds,\nit is turning us into workers.\n\nIt makes us ask stupid questions,\nand parade stupid ideals and fake political labels.\n\nWe can't have a world without real education,\nthe dark ages will swallow us through the various tax exempt churches and imaginary gods.\n\nIrrelevant worthless opinions will have us fighting for nothing,\nbecause they are all equally wrong, stupid, and useless.\n\nMy friends,\npay attention to fake education, and everything will work out in the end.\n\nWe will find out way to wisdom,\nwe will converge on World Peace in our Wisest and Noblest ideas.\n\nAll you have to do, is make it clear to everyone around you,\nthat you will not tolerate fake education, that you are not on that side of history.\n\nWrite, Rhyme, Paint, Tag,\nfind your way out of fake education and whatever else is pulling you away from wisdom.\n\nHold up you path, and show them the results,\nso that others may choose follow.\n\nReal Education is marked by wisdom,\nand it shows real results and contributions.\n\nAnd though your hard earned achievements may already be great today,\nyour work is not finished until it brings permanent or lasting contributions towards our eventual convergence on Peace and Wisdom,\n\nEvery Human Being on Earth matters,\nthey are our family.\n\nIf you accept this great endeavor, many who fell prey to fake education may hate you in their own sickness,\nbut their children and the children of their children will grow up in a world transformed, in no small part by you.\n\nWe are one people, we are all meant to be Truly Educated in Our Beautiful Minds,\nand we are all meant to live in safety and in peace looking after one another.\n\nWe are one people.",

on wisdom with the words Content of Character.\n\nThe most mechanically sound description is,\nunderstanding new things by subtle analogy to what we already know.\n\nThe most concerning view states that,\nwithout wisdom we will be making mistakes.\n\nI think most reasonable view; is all of the above,\nplus knowledge gained from Adventure, Philosophy, and Science Books and Audio Books.\n\nWhat is it for?\nWhy, it is our Operating System.\n\nPART II, Thought Experiment\n\nAllow me to share with you a thought experiment,\na way of seeing things that aid in your view of the world.\n\nWithout wisdom, we form tribes and elect leaders, shamans, or popes,\nand hire muscle, creatures of violence.\n\nBecause that is the same thing the other tribe is doing,\nand the weaker one will be destroyed with great horror.\n\nThese tribal bare bone behavior did not end in middle ages,\nas one would hope.\n\nThis behavior is the default human behavior for the frightened and uneducated,\nthe desperate, the angry, even the sick.\n\nWe may not understand why criminals do the things they do,\nbut we can imagine one of our family members, who one by one loses everything.\n\nAnd on the last day, when all he has left,\nis an ounce of sanity, and a beating hart, he will fight, steal, and hate just to live another day.\n\nAnd for those who can't imagine why one would like to live another day when it is all pain,\nto persevere memories, to keep the fallen alive.\n\nAnd here we meet a Man of Honor,\na Judge, along with a jury, and wealthy lawyers in fantastic shoes.\n\nAnd all they see is a mad man,\na criminal, a man who needs to be put in a cage.\n\nThe Judge is wrong,\nwhen it comes to putting people in cages, all judges are wrong.\n\nTo restore this man, he needs a home, and books, and friends,\nand an education, and hope, and reams, and free money, and free food.\n\nHe needs to be treated with love and dignity,\nand granted an opportunity to persevere his memories in a book.\n\nThere are no criminals,\nthey are just broken children.\n\nThe ugliness of the worst of them is just an act,\nthey just want to be left alone.\n\nAnd I suppose that evil men do exist,\nbut I don't think there is enough of them in the world to fill a single prison.\n\nThe 10,000,000 people we keep in cages,\nare just children with severe developmental issues.\n\nThere are no political systems advanced enough to treat these beings,\ntheir only hope is the Public Defender.\n\nThe Public Defenders will fight to keep the broken people out of prison,\nbecause they know prison will only make them worse.\n\nIf you ever wanted to see a real Angel,\nask a Judge to let you sit in on a court case, look that tired being in the eyes.\n\nWe are Human Beings,\nwe are not animals to be kept in cages.\n\nI have met snarling beasts,\nand I saw their red faces and bulging eyes, and they were just broken kids.\n\nAt first I wanted my older self to come and help me,\nbut later I just started calling them My Bullies, they never had a chance at a good life.\n\nAnd here we find a sliver of sanity,\nbecause there is something that can be done to control crime.\n\nIt is preventing children from being forced into that desperate mode of existence,\nPREVENTION.\n\nPrevention is a simple thing, Free Home, Free Food, Free Money,\nand Free Tutors, a Real Education.\n\nIt will take a psychologist to identify those who need help,\nit is as simple as that.\n\nNo suffering,\nno harm.\n\nAnd for those of you who are crazy enough to ask who will pay for this,\nlet us call the institution a Bank of Love, right at the Heart of a Country.\n\nThey print only as much money as people need to be taken care of,\nand they pride themselves in the amount of debt that nobody will come to collect.\n\nPrevention, is really about education,\nbecause an educated person can make a lot more than any government can grant them.\n\nSocial Programs, Real Welfare, or Universal Basic Income,\nwill grant a person a Home, a Car, Food, and all the necessities, but they can't pay for extras.\n\nThey'll pay for an education leading up to a Captains License,\nbut not the boat.\n\nPrevention will go a long way to bring the number of prisoners down,\nthese desperate beings are part of our family, it is all of us or none.\n\nWe are a young civilization,\nwe don't have governments that can handle Universal Basic Income.\n\nWe have governments,\nthat can barely handle themselves.\n\nWe can cross this bridge, the bridge where we eliminate poverty, and homelessness, and immense fear and suffering,\nsuffering that draws those who have the courage to keep fighting into addiction so that they don't burst out of pain.\n\nTo get there, to begin growing up as a civilization,\nthose of us who can handle it must take to Books and Audio Books and reach Wisdom.\n\nOnly in your Wisdom can the world begin growing,\nbeyond the noisy mess that desperate, blind and tone deaf career politicians created.\n\nThe youngest of you are going to inherit all these problems,\nbut you will also know that all of these problems are happening due to lack of wisdom.\n\nTreat the cause,\nand the symptoms will subside.\n\nOnly in wisdom,\ncan our civilization advance forward.\n\nPersonal Note,\n\nThose of you who are just learning about the world,\nknow that it is confusing because hardly anything works right.\n\nBe it a be it a Judge, or General, and most shockingly a Jury,\nthey are missing lessons that help them see the world as a Work in Progress.\n\nWe are still building the foundation,\nand we are getting too much interference from our leadership.\n\nLook no further than the complete loss of privacy,\nthis is a function of uneducation and desperation, and blindness.\n\nEnhanced interrogation, is even a more terrifying example,\nthe world has no faith in nations that practice torture.\n\nThe 13th Amendment to Constitution of United States did not end Slavery in Full\nit reads \"Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States\".\n\nYou have a lot of work on your hands,\nand you will have a lot of friends working just as hard as you, and all over the world.\n\nWhile you are still young, take to Adventure Audio Books,\nread them all, and especially pay attention to the part where the adventurer reveals the reason for this quest.\n\nIn less than a Hundred Audio Books that call to you,\nyou will begin becoming wise onward to becoming a great being.\n\nIt is in it self a great adventure,\nand if I may, a Memoir is best written as your life unfolds, it is never too early to start writing.",

required to permute all combinations of chemicals to give rise to life is, long.\n\nWe are here, because as unlikely as life is,\neventually, given enough time, and space, it emerges out of mere chaos and accident.\n\nWhen you look around this planet,\ndespite lateral gene transfer, unstoppable power of selection, we are the only branch that can reach wisdom.\n\nI think it is safe to say that some animals love and care, maybe admire,\nbut unfortunately try as they might Chimpanzees, Dolphins and Elephants can't build cities of thoughts and dreams.\n\nIn a word, we, the emergent intelligent creatures, are:\nrare.\n\nIn two words:\nBeautiful and Rare.\n\nWe have to examine what sets us apart from Chimpanzees ad Dolphins,\nand see what we can weave with it.\n\nIn the misery of cold caves,\nor the torture or concentration camps imagining gods goes a long way.\n\nIn the dark ages of child labor,\nor the sickness of slavery and inequality school goes a long way.\n\nIn the age of Mustard Gas,\nor poverty and disease and hungry rats, a national border goes far.\n\nIn the age of Mutually Assured Destruction,\nCold War and Global Threats, a University education can be useful.\n\nBut in the age of Internet, we enter a new era,\nwhere what imaginary gods, simple schools, crazy borders, and trendy universities bring us, is actually, unimpressive and clunky.\n\nWe grew,\nmy friends, it happened just now, just like that.\n\nA new way of learning:\nAudio Books on The Trail.\n\nNo university lecture,\ncan beat twelve beloved and world celebrated books on the same subject.\n\nUnlike Professors, books will bring you many a message, that you will discover between the lines,\nor in the lines of a companion memoir or biography.\n\nA professor will teach you Nuclear Physics,\nbut he cannot teach you the Love necessary not to participate in weapons research.\n\nA memoir,\nwill.\n\nAll the great books are connected, in the library books on weapons development will be connected to books about suffering in war,\nto books about the promise of World Peace...\n\nAnd if not, then the Librarian will catch you with her smile, before you fall,\nby contrast a Professor's smile is meaningless, if not fake.\n\nProfessors can only interfere with your development,\nno single university covers enough subjects to satisfy you, but a library does.\n\nWhile your Knowledge is a sure path to Wisdom,\nthere is something else, you need.\n\nYou need a taste of Greatness,\nyou will never find it in a University town, never.\n\nThere is but a handful of places on earth that will help you feel it,\nthose are the months long hiking trails found on each continent.\n\nWhen you connect the triumph of adapting to the hardships of a trail,\nin rain in snow...\n\n...to the inheritance of wisdom from books,\nI am sorry to say, that the first thing you will feel is a brief flash rage and tears.\n\nFor how could the Good World and the Professors you once respected betray you,\nby putting you into a little dorm room.\n\nAnd no lecture hall is big enough, or prestigious enough,\nto impress you more than the stars, and the silence, and fragrance of woods.\n\nHow could an old and experienced Professor teach you poetry, better,\nthan your beating heart, on the eve of your first encounter with a Bear, and her cubs.\n\nNo professor could ever reach as deep into your heart,\nas a book of inspirational verse, on that stormy night that you should have stayed in the valley below.\n\nAnd the Greatness of a simple warm morning filled with the fragrance of pine trees with a hint of last evening's bonfire,\nthat thick moist air, as you hand spiritually pushes straight through each page of paper book that you now comprehend better than the author, the day he finished.\n\nHe wrote as a mail sorter, or cast away, or patent clerk, or a star crossed overman,\nbut you read it, as an Emergent Masterpiece of The Universe, a Complete Human Being.\n\nLet the trail,\nbecome your semesters and diplomas and awards, and the returns to it, you never-ending graduation ceremony.\n\nSPEAK OUT,\ndo not let the others live unaware that Universities in their mediocrity have fallen to Nature Trails and Audio Books.\n\nSPEAK OUT,\ndo not let other students aim for a job, their job is to build companies, onwards to becoming Great Leaders.\n\nSPEAK OUT,\ntell them about your rage and tears of being denied a real education that fits you.\n\nSpeak Out,\nspeak out.\n\nIn wisdom, and in certainty of knowing that your path is the correct path,\nit is the path of real results, Wisdom, and Greatness.\n\nThe Trail,\nand that thread, are one and the same.\n\nAnd the grades, every one of your grades will far surpass any and all scales,\nin cold rain, in snow too deep to traverse, in hunger two days out from the next town, upon your arrival you rise to a new height, that no grade can mark.\n\nAfter a few years,\nwhat you have weaved out of your books, will be unbreakable, and so unique as to extend precisely who yo are, far into, who you must become to reach greatness.\n\nA day will come, when you will notice the struggle of authors to rise higher,\nand in sadness discover that you will find fewer and fewer books that move you, eventually where your last book ends.\n\nYour own book,\nwill start.\n\nAnd you will add to the mountain peak you climbed,\nand others will follow, and your book will become their last book, and so on.\n\nThat's how you will know what is real,\nwhat is fake, by taking every important step to the highest of heights and leaving your Soul behind for others to resurrect it when your book comes up.\n\nWorry not, countless others have traveled these roads,\nwisdom is real, it is meaningful, it changes you and others for better, and your book will be irreplaceable and beloved by many.\n\nAnd, no, it is foolish to think that you must become an author to write a book, there are too many of those books already,\nyou only need to become wise to write, there are no critics here, as you cry, the reader will cry, as you climb the next mountain, the reader will triumph with you.\n\nTake your self-education to the trails,\nthe nature will help you slow down and connect with the spirits of the authors stored within the books.\n\nDon't worry, it will be OK,\nso as long as all your steps count as a triumph, your growing up will become an upward slope, and your life will eventually become as beautiful as you.\n\nAnd the last thing a Great Being discovers,\nis the answer to their first big question \"Who am I?\", it will all lay open as you look back from your golden age.\n\nYour path to wisdom intertwined with adventure and great discoveries,\nand bears, and dunes, and Fox Fire, and rain and snow, and softness of moss, and endless seas of fern, open like all the great ideas behind all the most beloved of poems.",

in their mediocrity have fallen to Nature Trails and Audio Books.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>SPEAK OUT,</p>\n  <p>do not let other students aim for a job, their job is to build companies, onwards to becoming Great Leaders.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>SPEAK OUT,</p>\n  <p>tell them about your rage and tears of being denied a real education that fits you.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Speak Out,</p>\n  <p>speak out.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In wisdom, and in certainty of knowing that your path is the correct path,</p>\n  <p>it is the path of real results, Wisdom, and Greatness.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The Trail,</p>\n  <p>and that thread, are one and the same.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And the grades, every one of your grades will far surpass any and all scales,</p>\n  <p>in cold rain, in snow too deep to traverse, in hunger two days out from the next town, upon your arrival you rise to a new height, that no grade can mark.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>After a few years,</p>\n  <p>what you have weaved out of your books, will be unbreakable, and so unique as to extend precisely who yo are, far into, who you must become to reach greatness.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>A day will come, when you will notice the struggle of authors to rise higher,</p>\n  <p>and in sadness discover that you will find fewer and fewer books that move you, eventually where your last book ends.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Your own book,</p>\n  <p>will start.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And you will add to the mountain peak you climbed,</p>\n  <p>and others will follow, and your book will become their last book, and so on.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>That&apos;s how you will know what is real,</p>\n  <p>what is fake, by taking every important step to the highest of heights and leaving your Soul behind for others to resurrect it when your book comes up.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Worry not, countless others have traveled these roads,</p>\n  <p>wisdom is real, it is meaningful, it changes you and others for better, and your book will be irreplaceable and beloved by many.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And, no, it is foolish to think that you must become an author to write a book, there are too many of those books already,</p>\n  <p>you only need to become wise to write, there are no critics here, as you cry, the reader will cry, as you climb the next mountain, the reader will triumph with you.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Take your self-education to the trails,</p>\n  <p>the nature will help you slow down and connect with the spirits of the authors stored within the books.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Don&apos;t worry, it will be OK,</p>\n  <p>so as long as all your steps count as a triumph, your growing up will become an upward slope, and your life will eventually become as beautiful as you.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And the last thing a Great Being discovers,</p>\n  <p>is the answer to their first big question &quot;Who am I?&quot;, it will all lay open as you look back from your golden age.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Your path to wisdom intertwined with adventure and great discoveries,</p>\n  <p>and bears, and dunes, and Fox Fire, and rain and snow, and softness of moss, and endless seas of fern, open like all the great ideas behind all the most beloved of poems.</p>\n</div>",

GPA,\nhomework deadlines, and even subconsciously knowing that memorization is not education, will conspire against us.\n\nLearning for real, real education, useful knowledge,\nthriving wisdom, and eventual greatness demands a beautiful and authentic existence.\n\nIn real life, getting a diploma by cramming, memorizing, winging it or getting lucky,\ndoesn't actually do anything.\n\nReality, demands real things,\ntruth, authenticity, and a healthy existence.\n\nA beautiful life,\nrequires our full beauty.\n\nTo bloom, to truly grow up,\nwe need to be truly free, we need to reside in the real world.\n\nIt is not as easy as it sounds,\nthough we all have the ability to set ourselves free from childhood indoctrination.\n\nWhat about, the less obvious things?\n\nSuch as doing badly on a test some years ago, having your GPA permanently lowered because of it,\nbut on the day of graduation, actually being able to perfectly pass that test, but now during graduation it being too late.\n\nSo you are accepting a lower GPA, so that you can graduate sooner?\nthat is not how reality works, and what about the extra motivation that you would receive from keeping a 4.0 GPA throughout your entire stay?\n\nAnd what about the quality of that test,\nand what about the people that passed it because they memorized it without really learning anything?\n\nAnd what about the fact that that many will never need what was on that test,\nin effect the College or University slowing their progress down, distracting them from learning what would help them become more of themselves.\n\nAnd what about well connected and ingratiated liars, at the company you do end up working at,\nwhat if after years of tests and textbooks and frightening and stressful debt, a liar dislikes you?\n\nReality, will make you strong and beautiful, it will make your life meaningful and full of joy,\nbut you have to keep it real, the education must be real, your place of employment must be stable and honest.\n\nAt no point should you be pushed to the side,\nand forced to walk a path that is different from who you are.\n\nAnd do not forget, that we are granted a set amount of time,\nspending more than 30 years in pursuit of school and career that isn't guaranteed to be what you need, should be a tough proposition.\n\nNow, a real education coupled with a series of business undertakings that you learn from,\nand eventual launch of a successful company based on what you have learned is a lot more stable.\n\nSo, High School, College, University and a Career,\ndoes not hold the same guarantee that Self Education and eventually becoming a Successful Founder, does.\n\nIf you start leaning towards the Start-up Culture in High School,\nyou can start building your companies a lot sooner, and begin isolating and mastering the lessons that you actually need in the right sequence and at the right pace.\n\nJust for the fact that there are no bullies when you learn on your own,\nand zero pressure to memorize, and zero classes that will only distract you from learning what you need, self education is better for your mental health and growing up.\n\nCults and religions are not the only indoctrination,\nthey are just the ones that are trivial to catch.\n\nA Real University, would only feature Great Thinkers, Great Actors and Narrators,\nbut even so, their beautiful performances, though eye catching, would never be as perfectly fitted to you as a series of fine hand-picked audio books.\n\nEven an imaginary perfect-university, cannot match the power of a collection of audio books that you can listen and re-listen stress free,\nas you learn to build you companies and graduate to be able to grasp more and more complex subjects.\n\nLets just face it, being placed in a situation where you must merely memorize things,\nis a sign that you are being taken advantage of.\n\nLearning is not about memorization,\nand memorization has nothing to do with learning.\n\nMemorization is best used in poetry,\nit a way to give thanks to poets.\n\nEven if you memorize numbers of a new language,\nall you have left is a piece of information that is not yet useful.\n\nMemorizing 100 of the most popular words in a language you are learning,\nis almost dangerous as you will have trouble with correct pronunciation.\n\nTo learn a new language, you are best to create a path you can navigate and expand,\nwatch a movie you are already familiar with in your native language, and build a transcript.\n\nWe are good at language,\njust like we are good at dance, don't force it, love it.\n\nYour Knowledge is sacred,\nit empowers your decision making, and helps your dreams come true.\n\nWhen someone barges in forcing you to heartlessly memorize things,\nyou must become very suspicious of their motives.\n\nThe world is poor, there are slick talking people out there with all kinds of issues,\nsometimes they are deans, principals, teachers, and even parents.\n\nYou have to find a way to learn things right,\nI think we all know, that way, is not the school way.\n\nI know you are scared, bad grades, yelling parents, threat of poverty and homelessness,\nbut you see, that won't go away when you graduate by cramming, you are only delaying it.\n\nMoreover, by not becoming educated as soon as you can,\nyou become vulnerable to slick talking attackers, and shitty boyfriends.\n\nIt is damn hard to catch a liar, so hard that we can almost assume that liars always do win,\nit is because in their sickens they learn to exploit our cognitive biases.\n\nThe way to push back against manipulators,\nis to become smarter than they are, and believe you me, this barely takes any effort at all.\n\nAt most, AT MOST, 25 five audio books about modern life,\nthough they must all have a positive ending, they have to be happy books.\n\n25 audio books is like a month of your life,\nand, and, and if I may, it will be one of the most beautiful times of your life.\n\nYou will always return to where you were as you read them,\nso you better go to a nice place, or get in your car get on the longest highway and drive.\n\nYou can either start your life with a heart break,\nor with adventure and audio books.\n\nGrab your friends, tell them to behave,\nand go together.\n\nIf I may make a suggestion, lease stop at every antique store,\nas neat as the knickknacks are going to be, look for the most worn out books.\n\nI found a saintly copy of Robinson Crusoe,\nit fits in my back pocket so perfectly, I can't even.\n\nLook for Jack London, Herman Melville, Daniel Defoe,\nand keep an eye out for works by Friedrich Nietzsche.\n\nUse the paper versions to practice narration, but listen to the audio books,\nthey are often out on Librivox.org for free as most of the classics are in public domain.\n\nThat is all you need, to create an adventure,\na path to somewhere far that hits as many antique stores as you can drive by.\n\nAnd promise to drive carefully,\nyou are not in a hurry.\n\nNow, not everyone is ready to write,\nbut some of you are a lot further along than you think.\n\nBegin by writing a singe compound sentence at a time,\nand that's it, don't press, flow.\n\nJust like dehydration happens, or we sometimes develop vitamin deficiencies,\nand need to pay extra attention to what we put in our bodies.\n\nMy friends, same goes for our minds,\nfear or anxiety will cause you harm, you are not to live in fear of any kind.\n\nDo you know what the symptoms of anxiety are?\n\nImpatience, snapping at small things, thinning hair, wanting to be alone,\nsadness, brain fog, body aches, fatigue, bad sleep habits.\n\nThese are not things that we can fix, you can't take pain killers for body aches from from fear.\n\nBy calling it adventure, I give you a simple choice to make,\nbut it is more than a simple adventure, I am inviting you on a quest away from the toxic sludge of an unexamined life.\n\nIn a way, psychology is a young science,\nit is also the most humble and loving of all the Daughters of Philosophy.\n\nThere aren't too many answers here,\nbut there is something, and I can fit it in a sentence for you.\n\nThe secret to a long and healthy life is:\nHappiness.\n\nI am asking you to move away from fear and other disorders that create countless issues,\nand get on a path towards happiness, because that is a very powerful medicine.\n\nHappiness is quite a thing,\nit is almost on par with wisdom, though I suppose it the end it is one and the same.\n\nWhere wisdom makes you a beautiful writer,\nhappiness makes you a powerful doctor.\n\nThe low key sarcastic, low brow, poker face, dead pan nonsense,\nthat will feature in your journals due to Happiness and Love of Life.\n\nHas the power to bring the most boorish and scared person from the brink of death,\nand plop them in the middle of the Shenandoah Valley, walking stick in one hand and a bewildered companion in the other.\n\nI once wondered how we could describe the most powerful beings on earth,\nand somehow I came up with a two word description that still frightens-me-a-little to this day:\n\nThe Laughing Philosopher.\n\nWhile, I guess, I am not a real doctor, though the results are not quite in yet,\nI am certain that even those who are deeply sad will find something that will bring them a special kind of Happiness when out on an adventure.\n\nAnd I would argue, that the saddest of us, are the least likely to be eaten by a bobcat,\nor dragged away by a condor.\n\nAnd I know for certain, that the saddest of us,\nare the ones that eventually tell the happiest and most triumphant of stories.\n\nAll you need to do, is be aware of the terrible fact,\nthat the first few days of your adventure will feel wrong; you have to snarl through it.\n\nFight the urge to turn the car around,\nthat is just the toxic sludge within you fighting for survival, make sure it loses the battle.\n\nIt will only take a few days,\nand then, everything changes.\n\nOh my, when you get out of your car,\nand your hiking or trail running shoes hit the gravel, it is like hearing bells of kissing a hundred woodland faeries.\n\nBy taking that first detoxified step of your new adventure away from lies, bullies, limits and fears,\nyou can perfectly understand why dogs get zoomies sometimes.\n\nAnd hearing your first chipmunk,\nwill absolutely put all the damn birds to shame.\n\nNo job, or school, or employer, or alarm clock with a creepy snooze button, or any damn thing,\nhas any right to your joy of life - do you hear me?\n\nYou joy of life is sacred,\neverything else has to be secondary.\n\nYou are at your most beautiful, and you contribute to the world the most,\nwhen you are Happy, and occasionally mischievous.\n\nCall it an adventure, or intellectual hygiene,\nbut keep your backpack by the door, and may you be always ready, for the call of the wild.\n\nBecause that will mark the rise of your own personal University,\nand the beginning of your quest for real education and wisdom.",

emphasizing \"she doesn't know\".\n\nWhile not purrfect, this is a really good start,\nand erasing the deadline from its existence, is a sweet-sweet cherry on top.\n\nThere are too more things you could use, a handful or ungrateful friends,\nand a really well thought out backpack, and a large solar charger you can hang on the back.\n\nSee, you are not just headed for Key West and back,\nI m sure you will stop at all the antique stores, and hopefully pawn shops as they have good stuff too.\n\nA good pawn shop somewhere down in Florida or by an ocean is sure to have a cheap Wet Suit,\nit is a little known fact that they aid your buoyancy, it is like wrapping your self in a wee boat.\n\nI think it is really important to consider stopping by the highway accessible State Parks,\nthey are usually there because something beautiful is going on.\n\nYou never know what you find, it could be a little lake, maybe enormous dunes,\nit could be a hill with a historic watchtower of a lookout, or it could be a stable, with horses.\n\nPersonally, I think it is disrespectful for a man to sit on a poor animal,\nbut it is fine for a woman.\n\nAnd you certainly don't want to realize come your late golden age,\nthat you never rode a horse, and yet you always knew that you were a cowgirl at heart.\n\nNow, you see what I am saying, you go from a warm and cozy blanket on a lazy afternoon, facing an ugly week,\nto wondering how to make the damn animal stop galloping, because by now you are in the middle of the woods.\n\nAn hour later as you lead your new equine fiend back,\nit won't be just that you soul and heart are filling with beauty...\n\n...but somehow you will also gain a sense for how irrelevant your deadline was,\nhow nearly falling from your new spirit animal and soul-mate combined to repair your perspective.\n\nIt is never enough to merely dump indoctrination and repair misconceptions,\nthere is also a kind of a fog-of-war that luls you into a life that frankly, you already made too many compromises for.\n\nIn real life you do things out of love, in the other kind of life you compromise,\nand do that long enough and you will find yourself hardly noticing that you are walking a stranger's road - that ain't good.\n\nEventually, you pet and pat you horse, give the caretaker a smile,\nand stop at the next park.\n\nThe more stops you make, the more you will heal and the faster you will catch up with growing up,\nyou can almost feel it in your hands, they will fell empty without a journal.\n\nNow, let me just pause here for a second, and remind you, that you are removing unimportant things from your life,\nbe good to your journal, failing that get a second one, as the first one won't last long at all.\n\nDon't make the same mistake I did, I bought this beautiful leather bound thing,\nand figured why don't I use a pencil at first...\n\n...smart right?\n\nIt took me hours to try to erase the pages, and most of them still had annoying little bits of letters on it,\ntreat your journal like a friend, and speak in wee little bits.\n\nIf you want to speak at length,\ndo what I am doing, give advice, make a little audio file and put it on the internet.\n\nHealing will make it so that you will want to erase it because it will sound \"dumb\" to you after a bit,\nbut that is only because you are growing really quickly, catching up, others still need the simpler thoughts.\n\nA lot of people will stay in bed,\nthey will meet the deadline, and that snooze button will slowly turn their joy of life off.\n\nThere is still hope for them, maybe the boss will be super crazy and mean, hopefully,\nshe could then come around and tell them \"Hey! you will never get a raise again?\", that could still snap them out of it.\n\nBut, if the boss is not fully crazed,\nyou are their last hope.\n\nThe trouble you go through to learn to jog,\nor try to hit every state park, without really caring much for actually making it to Key West.\n\nAs all end of the road towns are tourist traps,\nso, it is true when they say it is the journey, not the destination.\n\nExcept maybe for those six toed cats that Ernest Hemingway left behind in his Key West home,\nvery few things will surprise you with independence, and a cat probably capable of of grasping tools is one of them.\n\nYeah, all the trouble, and little pit stops, and furry or maned discoveries, serve as a call to health,\nto all those who are almost ready for it, but not quite there.\n\nNo human should lead the life of a house cat,\nwe are very dynamic, and doing beautiful unusual things helps us stay healthy.\n\nOne, time, I camped next to a couple that brought their two year old to a hike-in site,\nit was clearly the husband's idea, the wife was angry, and the kid was crying...\n\nIt was a nice try, but they needed more vacations, and more babysitters,\nand not just camping, but jogging, trail running, and a plan to visit all the famous lighthouses.\n\nI am sure she loved the trouble of camping when they started dating,\nnow the inconvenience of it all was making the poor lady, angry, out of the storm of stress.\n\nI am certain, that she was blaming her self for it,\nand thinking of her self as just that kind of a person, nobody is angry like that.\n\nBetween the three of them, they had everything in the universe, except the trouble was so overwhelming and the fog-of-war so thick.\nThat this, clearly, mighty and courageous mom, was only racing forward to get stuff done.\n\nThey stayed the weekend,\nbut they needed at least three weeks if not months.\n\nThey needed to stop racing forward,\nthey needed more adventures, more \"inconvenience\", more trouble-making as I call it.\n\nThat woman in particular struck me as someone who needed to run the Western States 100,\nshe had the power for it, no, she has a soul for it.\n\nSee emanated the mana that bespoke that,\nthe standard marathons needed to qualify for western states meant nothing to her, it was just a blistering formality.\n\nAnyway, still a glorious couple,\nand their little one will surely grow up to be an adventurer.\n\nAside from a raccoon I named Friday, using his cute little hands to soil my hot dog buns,\nthat week brought in another mighty being - this time a teenage boy.\n\nHis father passed away, and he pushed himself too far,\nthe psychologist put him on permanent medicine.\n\nI had the great honor of speaking to him, he told me he slept in fields and ditches,\nbut he had his sister, or mom, looking out for him.\n\nHe was a Powerful Troublemaker,\nI told him we need to care for ourselves, our bodies need vitamins, electrolytes, our minds need whatever they need.\n\n\"There is no such thing as crazy,\nyou just went through a lot in life, it was your life that got crazy.\" - I said to him.\n\nA thousand miles on a bicycle, which according to my maps requires a little trip to Canada, and a ferry,\nis all the proof needed that the kid was really special.\n\nI returned to my camp, and a day or two later,\na shadowy figure visited him, his mom probably, and without me paying attention I've noticed it was a slow and mighty, and very heavy conversation.\n\nKnowing he was well, I hope he continued his bicycling, at least to the upper peninsula,\nthough there was a ferry near by, so maybe he was headed for Chicago, I hope they both went.\n\nSee, here is a child well on his way to become a great being,\nhe was learning wisdom, and all he needed was backpack, a bicycle, and a thousand miles of road.\n\nTrouble-making is no joke, it an art,\nand it is medicine worthy of great heroes.\n\nIf you, my Dear Reader, get stuck, or stung, or scared, or get stuck in a fog of war,\nknow that it is not a time to try harder, and push harder, and let me tell you why without mincing words:\n\nBecause you are absolutely irreplaceable,\nand - what you think your flaws are - aren't, they are not flaws, this is your uniqueness.\n\nYou will only exist once in the universe,\nand though you can rain wrath precisely like a god, you also need to pace yourself.\n\nThe best kind of a Warrior is a Laughing Philosopher,\nnot a Berserker (that's too easy), be an Artist.\n\nIt is a huge part of the art of living,\nto quit blaming yourself for being angry, or clumsy, or never finishing anything you start, or never finding the right person.\n\nYou are not angry, there is nothing wrong with you,\nyou just took on so much weight and made so many compromises that there is no more time left for you to be yourself.\n\nI know it sounds awful when I say something as simple and go ride a bicycle, or a horse,\nor give the campsite raccoons so much anxiety that they start clawing their way into nice people's backpacks.\n\nBut that is how it works, the way out of fog of war,\nmust be simple so that you have no trouble taking it.\n\nNo one is asking you to drop out of school permanently,\nyou're not going to be homeless, you will find a better job.\n\nYou only need to say the truth to your next employer,\nyour mental health, and your joy of life, and a balanced existence is critical to a healthy existence.\n\nJust because someone can lay down their life to meet a deadline whilst kissing ass and never asking for a raise,\nit does not mean anybody healthy will ever try.\n\nIf principals or teachers, or management or anything gets crazy on you,\ndon't quit, just don't comply because doing so will hurt you, just take a vacation, because your mental and physical health is more important than anything else, period.\n\nIf you are still not hearing this, if you are still not ready not to sacrifice yourself,\nlet me say this, there is a lot of people out there who like that Mighty Teenager do have a breaking point that will scare the bajezus out of a shrink, who is only too happy to prescribe something.\n\nYour self-compassion, your dignity, your beauty,\nand the power that your laughter, your foolishness, your silliness, your mischievousness, and above all your giggles exert on the universe that surrounds you is to important to us all for you to keep walking a path that is hurting you.\n\nYou are irreplaceable, and when you rise, and choose to share your stories,\nyou will build roads for others to follow.\n\nBy not putting up with what is hurting you,\nyou make the Universe a better place by becoming a beacon of sanity for those who will hear of your adventures.\n\nReturning to school or job with with this dignity and integrity of mind,\nwill change the way people treat you.\n\nNot just your confidence, but your wisdom, and strength, and balance,\nwill alter your body language.\n\nStressed people and relaxed people, give off different behavioral clues,\npeople including those in charge of budgets can read that very easily.\n\nTerrible people who lack compassion are everywhere,\nsometimes stressed out people will be abused with more stress just because they keep taking it on.\n\nThings get supremely complicated,\nin ways that we can't always understand.\n\nFor example the reason why someone loses their 4.0 may have nothing to do with their performance,\nbut with the teacher giving out too many A/s in the previous semester, and now just trying to average things out with the people who never complain, so that the dean doesn't come around complaining that his class sticks out.\n\nIt doesn't matter if it is High School, or College, or what used to be a Dream Job,\nthere are unethical fake it until you make it people covering their asses everywhere, it is a tragedy that someone like that should become a reason behind someone's years of suffering.\n\nThese are simple examples I am making up,\nin real life, there is no understanding of all the motives as people who never grew up, constantly interact with each other to to do less, and get more,\n\nTrouble-making is just a lighthearted way of leaving all that noise behind,\nand regaining your own beauty, and strengths, and awe for the world around you.\n\nGive yourself some trouble that actually makes you better for a change.\nif the path you re walking on feels wrong, you need to begin preparing an adventure backpack.\n\nA very special Monday is coming around,\nyour clock will go off just like always.\n\nBut this time it will die with a sad whimper as you - slowly and deliberately - unplug it from the wall,\nand return to sleep, not worried about your deadline, job or school, but simply knowing full well, that they don't matter anymore; because your well being is infinitely more important.\n\nThen get into your car, or on a bus, and set a direction for sunny weather,\ndrive, fly, just go, and do not wait to create your rules of adventure, do it as soon as possible.\n\nWhen your health returns to you,\nyou'll know exactly where you are going, and schools will always take you back, and jobs that hurt you are now worthy of your concern at all.\n\nDon't make plans about the rest of your life until you catch up where you need to be and become wiser as think things through.\n\nAnd finally, if you don't like the idea of trouble making,\nthen between You and I let us call it: Love of Life.",

mental health, and your joy of life, and a balanced existence is critical to a healthy existence.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Just because someone can lay down their life to meet a deadline whilst kissing ass and never asking for a raise,</p>\n  <p>it does not mean anybody healthy will ever try.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If principals or teachers, or management or anything gets crazy on you,</p>\n  <p>don&apos;t quit, just don&apos;t comply because doing so will hurt you, just take a vacation, because your mental and physical health is more important than anything else, period.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If you are still not hearing this, if you are still not ready not to sacrifice yourself,</p>\n  <p>let me say this, there is a lot of people out there who like that Mighty Teenager do have a breaking point that will scare the bajezus out of a shrink, who is only too happy to prescribe something.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Your self-compassion, your dignity, your beauty,</p>\n  <p>and the power that your laughter, your foolishness, your silliness, your mischievousness, and above all your giggles exert on the universe that surrounds you is to important to us all for you to keep walking a path that is hurting you.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You are irreplaceable, and when you rise, and choose to share your stories,</p>\n  <p>you will build roads for others to follow.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>By not putting up with what is hurting you,</p>\n  <p>you make the Universe a better place by becoming a beacon of sanity for those who will hear of your adventures.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Returning to school or job with with this dignity and integrity of mind,</p>\n  <p>will change the way people treat you.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Not just your confidence, but your wisdom, and strength, and balance,</p>\n  <p>will alter your body language.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Stressed people and relaxed people, give off different behavioral clues,</p>\n  <p>people including those in charge of budgets can read that very easily.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Terrible people who lack compassion are everywhere,</p>\n  <p>sometimes stressed out people will be abused with more stress just because they keep taking it on.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Things get supremely complicated,</p>\n  <p>in ways that we can&apos;t always understand.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>For example the reason why someone loses their 4.0 may have nothing to do with their performance,</p>\n  <p>but with the teacher giving out too many A/s in the previous semester, and now just trying to average things out with the people who never complain, so that the dean doesn&apos;t come around complaining that his class sticks out.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It doesn&apos;t matter if it is High School, or College, or what used to be a Dream Job,</p>\n  <p>there are unethical fake it until you make it people covering their asses everywhere, it is a tragedy that someone like that should become a reason behind someone&apos;s years of suffering.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>These are simple examples I am making up,</p>\n  <p>in real life, there is no understanding of all the motives as people who never grew up, constantly interact with each other to to do less, and get more,</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Trouble-making is just a lighthearted way of leaving all that noise behind,</p>\n  <p>and regaining your own beauty, and strengths, and awe for the world around you.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Give yourself some trouble that actually makes you better for a change.</p>\n  <p>if the path you re walking on feels wrong, you need to begin preparing an adventure backpack.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>A very special Monday is coming around,</p>\n  <p>your clock will go off just like always.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But this time it will die with a sad whimper as you - slowly and deliberately - unplug it from the wall,</p>\n  <p>and return to sleep, not worried about your deadline, job or school, but simply knowing full well, that they don&apos;t matter anymore; because your well being is infinitely more important.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Then get into your car, or on a bus, and set a direction for sunny weather,</p>\n  <p>drive, fly, just go, and do not wait to create your rules of adventure, do it as soon as possible.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When your health returns to you,</p>\n  <p>you&apos;ll know exactly where you are going, and schools will always take you back, and jobs that hurt you are now worthy of your concern at all.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Don&apos;t make plans about the rest of your life until you catch up where you need to be and become wiser as think things through.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And finally, if you don&apos;t like the idea of trouble making,</p>\n  <p>then between You and I let us call it: Love of Life.</p>\n</div>",

graded down under the threat of being held back and repeating the year.\n\nNobody is learning anything useful, everyone is memorizing,\nand teachers, grades, and threats of being held back only reinforce memorization.\n\nThat is not education,\nthat is memorization, acting.\n\nOur loading program does not load,\nour operating system does not initialize.\n\nSystem crashes,\nand fathers

reemerged,\nbut what is actually going on is that mis-educated people are self assembling into desperate groups.\n\nWe are seeing groups self-reinforcing each other's beliefs based on color of

about paying those fraudulent institutions - instead of funding ones that are capable of Real Education.\n\nThings are pretty bad, thankfully, we are infinite in our capacity to deal with real dangers,\nespecially the ones that tear tear our family apart.\n\nReal education is based on students' predispositions,\nand curiosities.\n\nFor example, when someone is interested in the moon or stars at night,\nthat marks an entry point into Science Fiction, Astrophysics, Astrography and if they continue to care, Optics, Mathematics, Physics, Writing and so on.\n\nMost children won't care for stars very long, because they are interested in exploring all of the universe,\nand that is even better because then there is a multitude of passage ways they can use to walk through the sciences.\n\nBut it has to be their own walking, their own direction, and at their own pace,\nwe have to honor their predispositions and curiosities, the students are the future.\n\nWe have to remove grades, tests, graduation, class rooms, time divisions, subject divisions, rows of seats, groupings of any kind be it age or area of study,\nwe have to replace the teacher with personalized learning and tutors.\n\nAnd we have to give the students what they need, a telescope, a fast single board computer with all the sensors and servos they could ever need,\nthey need the ability to launch satellites, to operate small remotely operated submarines and small drones, they need access to things they are curious about.\n\nIf a student is walking the wrong path, then it is a path that has been been walked many times before, they are asking a question, and they need powerful answers,\nthey have to see what war is like, what prisons are like, what concentration camps are like -

you for your Great Achievements.\n\nThe diploma you receive at the end of your stay in school,\nwhile it grants you access to higher institutions and more advanced jobs...\n\n...it will not prevent those jobs from endangering or sacrificing you for profit,\nthe best lies are the ones that others maneuver you into believing, choices you would never make without their poison.\n\nYour life, does not compare to other lives, no matter how precious or numerous,\nthere is no Life Arithmetic.\n\nThe closest you can get to a formula is this wonderful contradiction:\nEach life is more important than the other.\n\nIf someone ever asks you to do something for the greater good, you are not sacrifice,\nyou quit your job or await your dishonorable discharge, and begin your search for Enlightenment and Wisdom, onward to becoming a Great Being.\n\nIf the best job you can possibly get, holds some measure of risk,\nthen you are going to need to try harder.\n\nIn case you are wondering,\n- I care, and you can't undo that.\n\nThe harder, or the less worn path,\nis that of becoming an Independent Inventor and Entrepreneur.\n\nAnd you are not going to be the first or only one,\nfind the others, find a couple of co-founders, learn from your Noble Failures as well as Triumphant Successes.\n\nSo when someone says \"Diploma\",\nyou reply; \"Check Your Premise\", to quote an old friend.\n\nWhen they say calculator,\nyou say: \"Help me with programming not memorizing formulas.\"\n\nWhen they box you in to memorize,\nyou get the others to drop the class, because you need a real education, one that helps you to wisdom and greatness.\n\nWhile governments are smart enough to encourage learning,\nas evidenced by mandatory education, they are not smart enough to tell a real education from a fake one.\n\nI suspect the intelligence of governments is dictated purely by the voters,\nin that wise people will not vote in uneducated representatives.\n\nBut you see the small catch-22 or egg and chicken problem,\na government can't easily become intelligent enough to encourage real education, without majority of voters being educated for real.\n\nThe way to do boot the process and hopefully sustain it,\nis to mirror the educational paths of pioneers and founders, in a short: Self Education.\n\nSelf education is not that outrageous,\nthat is what real schools are supposed to encourage you to do, without any interference.\n\nAnd let me underline that interference will destroy self education,\ngrades, cookie cutter curricula, the threat of repeating classes or even semesters can destroy a beautiful and delicate mind.\n\nSelf education is like learning to walk, except this time you learn to move in the Universe,\nand instead of getting your feet to move quite right, you are trying to find the audio books that somewhat fit what you already know.\n\nFinally on a related subject, it hurts me to say it, but \"Free College\" is not quite right,\nit should be \"Free Real and Effective Education that Shows Real Results\"\n\nCompare that to the an Important Vaccine, we don't need a mere Free Shot of Something spelled out with weasel words,\nwe need a real and effective vaccine that shows real results across millions of participants.\n\nYou should not allow yourself to think of College or University as something that gets you a good job,\na good job is nothing, the dumbest of liars can get you fired if you get in their way.\n\nThe thing you must look for is Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness,\nas that opens all the gateways ahead of you; but more importantly that path is most worthy of you, it is the most human and healthiest of paths.\n\nAll you need to start is a small bowl of ice cream, an electric blanket, a fine pillow, a comfy bed,\nand a narrated book by Carl Sagan, or Neil deGrasse Tyson, or Bill Bryson.\n\nAnd then as you get going, and maybe take to liking new titles from best-seller lists and new authors you have never heard of,\nfind a a small, perhaps, pocket sized, well respected book on Bush Craft, and start getting ready for your first tiny venture into the Wild by buying a backpack and a tent...\n\nYou will need a pair of cut proof gloves, a 16\" Bowie knife (don't do 14\"), get high quality Damascus, Stag Horn Handle, fine leather sheath, full tang, obviously...\nand a second actually useful Bush Craft Knife, and then splurge on a sharp fordable hand saw you can bring along to all adventures, and get an audio book, and fire going as everyone else is still hacking away.\n\nAs you read more and more,\nand things start making sense, as you slowly and independently begin forming an accurate view of the world.\n\nBring a cheerful friend, or your mum, to a near by state park,\none with a fine beach and a tidy nick-knack store that also doubles as a hot dog stand and perhaps serves a fine and spicy vegetarian alternative.\n\nLater on, grab couple of lovely and trusting friends,\nfool enough to try to through-hike the Applachin Trail with you in one go from Springer Mountain to Mount Katahdin.\n\nThough I highly recommend section hiking at first,\nand also, please, please, visit Henry at Walden Pond each time you climb Katahdin.\n\nYou know, it is hard to miss the fact that a tent in bear country makes for a fine dorm room,\nand that each white blaze you meet on the AT, doubles as an A+ that no teacher could possibly give you.\n\nAnd that each time you make it up Katahdin with a hundred new books on your mind,\nyou do graduate ever higher.\n\nI think both Henry and the Mountain grant you some of their height\n- I know for certain without a doubt; and I know you can feel it too: You are meant to become a Great Being.",

world that needs vision.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>On the other hand, a well educated, knowledgeable and wise voting majority,</p>\n  <p>isn&apos;t one to get confused, or become mislead, easily.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>A vision is always something that most of humanity has already agreed on,</p>\n  <p>though they might have forgotten parts here and there, or worded them differently.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>For example:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Climate Stabilization</p>\n  <p>Human Dignity</p>\n  <p>World Peace</p>\n  <p>Universal Human Rights</p>\n  <p>World Disarmament</p>\n  <p>Functional Education</p>\n  <p>End Of Poverty All Around The World</p>\n  <p>Universal Basic Income</p>\n  <p>World Unity</p>\n  <p>Justice</p>\n  <p>Authenticity, and Truth.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>As we progress from well-read, to knowledgeable, to wise, and onward to our greatness,</p>\n  <p>we will collect and hold in our hearts many such Hopes and Dreams.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>At first they may seem like words or beautiful ideas,</p>\n  <p>but as we look into Memoirs, and beloved and honored works of great story tellers, they will become more.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>With a few dozen books a concept that has been lost on leaders of humanity,</p>\n  <p>will come to life in our hearts.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Rather than trying to flawlessly comprehend the world,</p>\n  <p>which may not be possible due to too many liars who by definition lack in vision, and are merely responding to stimuli for maximum self gain.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>We gain the ability hold up several of our most beloved Aims, Hopes and Dreams,</p>\n  <p>and ask what are the leaders doing to fulfill them.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is much easier to look at a leader&apos;s sum of history,</p>\n  <p>and notice that they have never done anything meaningful for World Peace and Elimination of Poverty, than to await their promises to come true.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>We can then ask, if we want to vote on people who do not recognize World Peace and Elimination of Poverty as an aim,</p>\n  <p>and what those people must be like.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>More importantly, holding a meaningful vision helps us grow up stronger and faster,</p>\n  <p>helps us focus our energies and curiosities on things that we become passionate about.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When a wise voting majority becomes passionate about Human Dignity,</p>\n  <p>the strength that arises from Unity of Vision can easily repair World&apos;s Nations and help Humanity Grow.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Without a wise consensus things that are concurring around the world are probably mostly random,</p>\n  <p>with elections won by those who spend most money on taking on a pleasing shape, and disasters being a predictable result of corruption and shortsightedness.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is hard to blame leaders and voters for something as disabling as lack of education,</p>\n  <p>people who lack knowledge pave their ways with their best intentions, alas Humanity&apos;s most beloved works of non-fiction must come first, lest we continue repeating the same old mistakes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>There is nothing difficult</p>\n  <p>about falling in love with Good Ideas,</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When we take to Adventures and Books, and a new book surprises us with a like selection of Hopes and Dreams,</p>\n  <p>we can only discover how connected we all really are, that we are in fact one big family.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>What are your Hopes and Dreams?</p>\n  <p>What is your Vision of The Future Of Humanity?</p>\n</div>",
