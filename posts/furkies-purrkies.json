And you must keep walking forward. Your own step, after your own step.\nIn your own direction, towards the things that move you, only then can You be Trully Moved.\n\nIt must the correct combination of books, poems, steps, events, summers, and epochs.\nDo not try to hurry, do not change roads, only move up, only think, and envision, and grow.\n\nThat which leads to Your Greatness, to Your Freedom, to Your Nature, requires, Truth.\nWalk your own path at your own pace. Only the correct key, can set your mind free.\n\nThe others who seem to have it all right.\nOften get lost on alien paths, and merely put on a happy face.\n\nWhile it seems like you are trapped today, you are not, it is just an illusion.\nLook towards the car keys.\n\nThat is all it will take. Grab the keys and go.\nIt will be very difficult at first.\n\nThe toxic build up that is keeping you from getting up, right now,\ntakes three days to crumble. It is a heavy cage.\n\nBut there is a way.\nA simple way.\n\nGrab the keys, and go... i275 south, merge onto 75 south,\nand take it all the way down... Florida Keys, US Highway One.\n\nIf you live in Florida, then you are headed for Michigan's Upper Peninsula.\nIf you live West, your destination is all the way East.\n\nIt is not the destination, it is the Journey, my Friend.\nTake your time, watch the cage crumble and fade as you go.\n\nOnly the important things, will stay.\nAnd you'll get to see yourself again.\n\nAnd you'll get to be free again,\nyou will resume where you left of.\n\nA life of bondage,\nis not worthy of you.\n\nLife is not meant to be a cage, or cruel, or frighten you.\nYou knew this as a child, and you let that slip away, not even noticing when it went.\n\nIt is your Right to resist being pushed into places that you don't want to be in.\nIt is your Right to reject conditions that you never agreed to, that you were pushed into.\n\nHow else can the Universe be worthy of us, how else can our lives be beautiful.\nHeaven and Paradise are real, but they are now, right now. Now.\n\nHow can people love you, when your own love for yourself is slipping away.\nYou have to. You have to accept the responsibility for your Health, and Dignity.\n\nYou don't have to make it all the way, the first time,\nand you don't have to leave your phone behind.\n\nYou can call this therapy, or a vision quest, you can call it a road trip.\nYou are not allowed to live in a cage, of whatever constitution, that will make you ill.\n\nIt comes to you naturally to take care of your body,\nbut your mind also requires care.\n\nWhen you reach your Freedom, you'll know what to do next,\nit can be another trip, East, or West.\n\nIf you feel trapped, the Universe is darker for it.\nTake a week.

      "text": "Well, from the first moment on,\nwe are asked if we should live in harmony.\n\nWe are still very young,\nbarely know of the world.\n\nAnd already the question of harmony comes,\nand in harmony we learn, and thrive.\n\nAway from it, we'll be interrupted,\nand feel lost in the void.\n\nIt is a simple choice,\nbut out minds are not ready to make it.\n\nOften we forget.\n\nWe forget about our little gardens,\nand all the little walks.\n\nWe forget how amazing it felt,\nto stand on the wing of a plane.\n\nWe forget the taste of popcorn at the Zoo,\nor even how enormous Zoo felt.\n\nWe forget pebbles at the river,\nand mischievous squires at the park.\n\nThat little dog with a bark,\nthat scaredy kitten always hiding in the dark.\n\nOur collection of unused keys,\nand the box of bottle caps we collected with ease.\n\nWe forgot our Lego and the old bike,\nwith that seat that we used to really like.\n\nWe don't remember the Palaces and Castles,\nthat we used to love, and those swords, that fit us like a glove.\n\nEverybody else came around,\nacting like they know the ground.\n\nBut, this was our gift from the Universe,\nan affinity for flowering gardens, and little passage ways, and all those flying planes.\n\nIt was a key to unlock our mind,\nto understand the zoo, and our size in the universe, connect with pebbles at the beach.\n\nIt is a pathway that fits us best,\nto love little creatures, and collect some shineys, and build with blocks, and ride far and wide.\n\nIt was to remind us,\nto find our place among Great Beings, and study and pursue excellence, in all we do.\n\nThen they sent us to First Grade,\nand the weird kid peed into the Duplo, they didn't even have Lego.\n\nThen the teacher graded you down for counting pebles in your pocket,\nand did it so many times, you lost track.\n\nThere was a whisper about the pebbles,\nit was Mr. Sagan - \"You are made of Star Stuff.\"\n\nAnd then the kids whispered...\nto push you in the mud.\n\nPush their laughter aside,\nyou'll need to Learn, and learn really hard.\n\nCause right now, you're in the mud,\nand you need to hang on.\n\nIt will get worse,\nbut all you have to do is rise.\n\nEach time,\nyou'll rise higher.\n\n(When in trouble, call the Police it is OK for kids to call the Police, they'll love helping you, don't be scared.)\n\nThird Grade,\nFifth Grade.\n\nLow grade,\nUhh, but there can't be higher.\n\nBecause by this time, you're getting bad grades,\nbecause the teacher thinks you're copying from somewhere.\n\nThe bullies know,\nyou did it on your own.\n\nSaw you pacing for days,\nwith your first program.\n\nKeep going forward,\ndon't let go - you're doing great, stay away from the hate.\n\nBy the time you're out of Eight Grade,\nby rejecting crazy, and nonsense, and stupid, and lazy, you graduate above all others.\n\nBecause you didn't follow,\nbecause you chose to study on your own, at your own pace.\n\nBecause worthless grades meant nothing,\nyou felt no stress.\n\nBecause, you didn't follow\nnothing could hurt you.\n\nAnd your world is yours,\ntruly-truly yours.\n\nWe unravel, when we forget who we are,\nthe moment we hide, or pretend, or follow.\n\nAnd, gosh darn it,\nit happens when we are still kids.\n\nWe are completely unprepared,\nand none will help.\n\nSo you! have to keep it together,\nyou can't let anyone hurt your mind.\n\nIn High School, the pretenders make a sudden appearance,\nnever held a book in their hand.\n\nThe back of Hamlet,\nall the quotes have more IQ.\n\nLet the little Caesars,\nkeep the wind from the hall away.\n\nYou need to pace your reading at the library,\nteach yourself focus.\n\nDon't EVER! finish the books,\njust get to the part that is valuable to you, and skip the rest.\n\nStart working on your start-up early,\nit is a study in failure.\n\nYou need to create a series of CONTROLLED FAILURES,\nthis is very important.\n\nLearn [content management][1],\nand figure out [billing][2]\n\nThat's your surface platform,\nand think about nature of business.\n\nNever try to build things directly,\nfacilitate the building of direct things for others.\n\nHelp them setup,\nso that you are not burdened, and keep going.\n\nLook at the structure of start-up accelerators, or even banks,\nthey take a percent, and never create what will weigh them down.\n\nEventually, you can build your own Tesla,\nbut at first, you start with services.\n\nLook at the gym,\nmonthly subscription, is most stable.\n\nThe lessons, are all around you.\n\nYou don't need college,\nbut taking college classes is very relaxing.\n\nMake sure you get a 4.0 at each class,\nbe ready to repeat it.\n\nAnd enjoy,\nthe lectures.\n\nCollege is just a toy,\nit looks bad on your Portfolio, so hide it.\n\nIt is a very weak teaching experience,\nand people know that there there is minimal learning involved.\n\nJumping from high school to start-ups is more impressive,\nand shows that you chose knowledge over nonsense.\n\nIt shows that you chose to learn on your own,\nto take care of your own mind,\nrather than to pretend to learn for grades.\n\nAuthenticity is very important in life,\nit is hard to connect with people that role play.\n\nBonding with people that are just acting,\nis only functional for as long as they are acting.\n\nBut it is never good,\neventually they'll have a crisis, similar to a mid-life crisis.\n\nStay Authentic,\nkeep to to those who are Authentic.\n\nBe safe.\n\nWhen it feels like everyone else is having an amazing life,\nand you are stuck.\n\nUmm... that not true\n\nBut it is also not healthy to think this way about yourself,\nyou are not beneath the party goers, they don't have what you have in your mind.\n\nBut, that's far enough,\ntime to get some rest.\n\nThis is where it gets interesting,\nyou have primed your mind for Business.\n\nThat is a fine first step,\nnow you need to get ready for the real graduation.\n\nYou need to section hike the equivalent of the Appalachian Trail,\nand measure your jogging a hundred miles at a time.\n\nSection jogging, the Western States 100.\n\nMind and Body, for the rest of your life.\n\nYou must take good care of both.\n\nAt mile fifty, halfway through a run,\nas you piece together your blurry thoughts of your next business.\n\nTake some time to understand what it is that College Grads have,\nthose are very brittle relationships, and inflexible careers.\n\nWe all feel the promise, but we can't fake it,\nit would be the opposite, and certainly not worthy of you, my Friends.\n\nYou can only find your meaning in Authenticity,\nshortcuts will only take you back to the beginning.\n\nTo live among the Extraordinary,\nyou must become Extraordinary yourself.\n\nThe gateway to Meaning of Life,\nis in that tiny moment when you think to your self:\n\n\"I am not going to jog tonight, I need rest.\"\n\nRight there in that dot,\nis the keyhole,\nto the key that you are,\nto the gateway that you need to open.\n\nLife is not a simulation,\nthere are no days off,\nlife is quite a challenge,\nand demands that each moment builds on the authenticity of the previous.\n\nOpen the dot, how can you yearn for Authenticity and Companionship,\nand cancel, and fall short, and not enough, and rest some more.\n\nThe gateway between Ordinary and Extraordinary,\nis in accepting that we haven't got a choice to make.\n\nBut shoes... to put on,\nyour Mind and Body must grow in harmony.\n\nYou must not let go of the Harmony,\nof your Magnificent Existence.\n\nEach small success, by subtle analogy,\npushes you forward, to your next step.\n\nEventually your tightly controlled business failures,\nwill fail, they will, fail to fail.\n\nYour mind too,\nit won't perceive the easy choice as an option.\n\nAll- will proceed,\nin harmony.\n\nLabored breathing,\nby the Pine Trees at Western States,\n\nAnother great step in Automation of your business,\nand more investors.\n\nAnd you're no longer stopping at the first thing you find in books,\nyou understand all of it.\n\nWhat is made by humans,\nis also All Too Human.\n\nAnd the Bullies are Gone,\nand Eight Grade still sucks.\n\nHigh school ... influences,\nare trying to figure out where they went wrong - good luck!\n\nCollege, is still a very romantic idea,\nbut it is best left to imagination.\n\nYour dreams are so much more now,\nonly what you create can live up to them.\n\nYou are a Leader,\nfull of might an joy.\n\nAnd now you know,\nshortcuts only lead people to their beginnings.\n\nAnd the one road, the only road,\nwas the one of Authenticity, and Achievement.\n\nWhere we learned for real, not for grades,\nwhere what we learned added up to create wisdom, and not a stupid GPA.\n\nYou'll be OK, so as long as you Learn onward and become Wise,\nand Live in Authentic Harmony with Yourself.\n\nThis is how you become an Adult,\nthat was the one thing that all others were missing.\n\nIt's what made them pretend and simulate,\nbut, growing up can't be faked.\n\nGrowing up has to be written by the choices you make,\non the surface, that is your lifetime.\n\nThe dreams you always dream, will come true,\nbut not in your childhood, childhood is for learning.\n\nLive in Harmony with yourself,\nand live in harmony with the Universe.\n\nGrowing up is really special,\nit is really important for our health.\n\nIt is a deeply internal process,\nand there are no shortcuts to growing up.\n\nIt is meant to be,\nBeautiful.\n\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=content+management\n[2]:

You don't need a charging bear to learn.\nYou can use clay, or canvas, or music.\n\nThere is no finer way to push loneliness away,\nthan to sculpt the meaning of touch.\n\nAnd there is no better way to learn courage,\nthan to paint a chain of works that inspire to motion.\n\nAnd music need not make someone cry to be powerful,\nmake the beat move your own feet, as you run your first ultra.\n\nConsider how simple a Desktop in your Operating System is,\nand yet, how perfectly impossible it is, to drag the icon out of the computer.\n\nIt is right there, you can wiggle it,\nand yet it is trapped in a prison, of invisible walls.\n\nAnd consider, how different you are, from all the people you have met,\nhow you don't even smile at the things that make them laugh.\n\nHow not a single person out of the Eight Billion,\ncould possibly take your place.\n\nHow often it feels that all the people around you are sleepy,\nhow some seem different, because they could not do, what they do, if they were not wide awake.\n\nTo integrate with wisdom, you cannot read the same books others read,\nyour mind represents a perfectly unique constellation of stars.\n\nTo integrate with wisdom,\nnot only do you have to indirectly wiggle around by subtle analogy to other things.\n\nBut you have to fish out just the perfect morsels that fit you,\nin just the perfect sequence, out of a unique collection of mutually reinforcing works of Philosophy.\n\nYou start in the beginning, with Survey Courses, as these outline the most brilliant ideas first,\nthere you can recognize thoughts that fit you, that you already had in your constellation.\n\nOrganized Education, poisons your confidence in education, because everything they teach,\nis in an inhuman, synthetic, and impersonal sequence.\n\nMoreover, the easily forgotten and fragile clusters of incomplete information,\naim to build on one another, they guarantee you won't understand, and will only overwhelm you in the end.\n\nThe celebrating of a Diploma, is a sacred ritual, that has been erased, and replaced,\nwith a more sugarcoated \"I am finally out\".\n\nThis is a perfect recipe for bondage, blindness, weakness,\nand worse.\n\nWe must not allow a fake sugar pop triumph,\nto replace the Real Triumph or Knowledge and Wisdom.\n\nIt can only get worse,\na day will come when the Libraries will close.\n\nSchool and Library, above all, were meant to be a symbol,\nan extension to your own self education.\n\nYour Education,\nthe pathway to Peace, Safety, Security, Self Control, Harmony, Enlightenment.\n\nWhat has occurred to cause the fog, is a drop of packets of information,\nwe are too complex, the world is too complex, parenting is too complex, teaching is too complex.\n\nIt can get worse, if we continue celebrating false graduations, and fake education,\nif we keep forgetting that our family, has Eight Billion members and each must grow up for real.\n\nThe solution is to remind ourselves, that growing up is not about feeling like an adult,\nbut rather Transcending our Limits, and Pushing Through gaps, towards Wisdom.\n\nWe face problems that can only be solved by Intellectual or Cultural Unity.\n\nThe Problem of War, is solved by Education, Wisdom, and Unity.\n\nThe Problem of Education, is solved by Helping Everyone to a Fair Start.\n\nThe Problem of Crime, can be Solved by Mental Heath Care, and Prevention.\n\nThe Problem of Poverty and Slavery, is Solved by Universal Income.\n\nAll these problems are our problems, and the solutions are ours as well.\n\nBut they rest across a Gap, a gap that Humanity must cross.\n\nAnd the next step,\nis your step.\n\nNothing worth your precious time, can be faked, or made up, or make believe,\nit all has to be Authentic, Powerful, Guttural, Raw.\n\nIt will hurt in the Muscle and Bone,\nbut eventually you'll forget to pay attention to what is unimportant.\n\nYou are not to be taught that you are dime a dozen,\nand that they just can't find a job for you, because you don't fit or conform.\n\nPeople believe this nonsense,\nbecause they don't have anything to draw from by subtle analogy.\n\nThat is why we must challenge ourselves to Great Deeds,\nto acquire the experiences necessary to tell Wisdom from Waste.\n\nWhen you hear someone putting you down, pushing you around, belittling you,\nyou are to leave, because that someone has fractured and broke, and are now ill.\n\nIt is the oldest and sickest trick,\nto convince someone they don't matter.\n\nThey do it for personal gain, money or laziness,\nto people who do not have a library of Grand Experiences from which they can draw wisdom, by Subtle Analogy.\n\nGet Up.\n\nFind your temple of solitude, The Two Beautiful Trees, The Bridge Over Hudson River,\nThe Highway Overpass, The Starry Beach where the Stars Come Out at Night and mingle with Starfish.\n\nAnd know, that you are a Child of The Universe, first,\nThat! is your background.\n\nNow face Humanity anew,\nout from the edge of the Universe.\n\nLook,\nlook at all those things that made you small.\n\nLook how unimportant the inauthentic is,\nhow fragile those words that upset you really were.\n\nAnd pay attention, to the real problem,\nhow easily you were tricked and mislead.\n\nThat cannot go on,\nyou are not a push around.\n\nI wish you knew how Powerful you really are,\nhow easily you learn at your own pace in the sequence that fits you best.\n\nHow All Too Human, all too familiar, all too easy,\nthe acquisition of wisdom really is.\n\nNot all Adults are defined by Outspoken Wisdom, some find Greatness in Love Returned,\nand what a Great Power, can those Two even make a mistake?\n\nI don't think there is anything other than Love, that can substitute for Wisdom,\nit is both The Love of Two, and The Love of a Big Mother in a large family,\na Mother that always brings hugs, warm meals and Wisdom.\n\nBut, True Love is rare, so while you search, you must also grow in Wisdom,\nfrom now on, you will have to learn to tell the children apart from the adults.\n\nAnd not by looking at how old they are, or how well they dress, or how sharply they move in their environment,\nyou will now look at their Authenticity, and Content of Character.\n\nNo one who lacks in Authenticity, or has little Content of Character,\nhas anything to contribute to you life, certainly nothing negative.\n\nHope for them to recover, and become wise, and healthy,\nlet them know that they are a Child of The Universe, and they count - but go.\n\nDon't let anybody hurt you,\ndon't let anybody hurt your heart, or mind.\n\nGo!\nbecause you need your heart and mind, to grow.\n\nGo!,\nwith the certainty of knowing that you are more.\n\nGo!,\nso as long as you Rise you won't be lonely for long.\n\nGo!\nbecause there has never been a way other than forward and up.\n\nGo!\nand don't be scared, all great journeys start with little things.\n\nThe Others, who went through the same,\nare with you in Spirit.\n\nSo many invisible battles have been fought,\nand as much triumph gone unnoticed.\n\nThe Warriors are everywhere, and they stand by your side,\nyou are in company of Great Heroes.\n\nClimb by subtle analogy to the triumphs already had,\nrise to the highest of mountains.\n\nYou are Meant to Become a Great Being,\nand You are meant to remind others to follow a similar path.\n\nRise, and you will be well on your way,\nHumanity only grows, when people like you tear down those thin invisible walls.\n\nWherever you are right now, begin transcending your limits,\nno matter how small, each will help you learn more.\n\nWith each new success more pathways will become visible to you,\nyou are not trapped, you are just at the beginning of your journey.\n\nIt is hard to see it all because you are still learning,\nbut it is easy to read or listen to books, and inherit great visions from others.\n\nIt will never get easier,\nbut you will grow greater, to a point where ease will become irrelevant to your existence.\n\nYou must use your Heart and Mind to learn all the lessons ahead,\nno one can teach you, you must find your own books.\n\nBy Subtle Analogy,\nRise to Your Greatness.",

Only prevention can work here.\n\nThe power of insight shows you that while you can't go back in time,\nyou can prevent the little ones from ending up in the same place.\n\nIn that way, you take the pain of those Punished and use it for a thing that matters,\npreventing children from following in their footsteps.\n\nAnd we get to feel others,\nwe get to feel when they have been Wronged.\n\nAnd we get to feel what they felt, when times got tough,\nand the power of Compassion makes us a Family.\n\nWho was it that gave [George Martorano][1] that little pencil,\npower of compassion is incredibly complex.\n\nYou hold hands with every wronged being on Earth,\nthose looking to their Favorite Star, wondering if someone else is looking there too.\n\nWe are, we all are, we are there with you,\nYou matter, your heart mattes, your mind matters, your life matters.\n\nAnd in Wisdom we will fix all of it,\nwhether we are ready to recognize that or not, we are a Family, and as One, We'll fix it all.\n\nIn that path we slowly walk together,\ntowards Happiness and Fairness, and Joy.\n\nWe will erase poverty and slavery with Universal Income and a Free Home with a picket fence.\nWe will erase crime with Care and Prevention, and Fairness.\n\nWe will erase war, blindness and stupidity, with Family Love and Wisdom.\nWe will erase all problems that plague the Human Family, it is what a family does.\n\nOne day, the world will stand united in fact,\nas opposed to being divided by opinion.\n\nNot even the Universe can stand in our way,\nour way is the Human Family Way.\n\nLike Wisdom,\nwe are Unstoppable.\n\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnuoHywbaR8\n\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnuoHywbaR8]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnuoHywbaR8",

clear.\n\nThere are no excuses,\nnothing to sway you.\n\nThe air is crisp,\nthere is no smog.\n\nJust,\na clear vision.\n\nEven without any guarantees in life,\nyou will become stronger.\n\nBut, yes - no matter how beautiful you become,\nUniverse will do nothing to guarantee you, anything.\n\nThis,\nis the Leap of Faith.\n\nAnd the faith,\nis in Your Greater Self.\n\nWalk your own path, because in the first half of your life,\nyour own path is the only thing that can add to you.\n\nAuthenticity, is a law of the Universe,\nit follows similar principles.\n\nWalk your own path,\nand expand.\n\nThe first steps are always clumsy,\nI went to the museums.\n\nA coffee shop is a bad idea,\nbecause everyone is there.\n\nBut a museum is different,\nit filters for kindness, somehow.\n\nI went to the D.I.A\nI was extremely lucky.\n\nThey were showing,\nAuguste Rodin's work.\n\nI understood it immediately, the secret of sculpture,\nis to enlarge that part that holds the soul.\n\nAt the end,\nthey had The Waltz (possibly a large replica as it had more detail, this was some 13 years ago), that dancing couple by Camille Claudel.\n\nI started crying,\nher hand, had so much feeling in that gentle arch, there was so much touch.\n\nThat is life,\nthat is the path.\n\nThe path, where you cry out of beauty,\nand not cry out of being lost.\n\nAnd you have to create art,\nart is about training yourself for success.\n\nLearning,\nby subtle analogy.\n\nThat's why you never finish,\nthere is no time for the art it self.\n\nThere is only time,\nfor learning life.\n\nLearning by subtle analogy,\nto the smaller Triumph, and Success.\n\nStick to a single subject,\nuntil you fill it completely.\n\nNow you can hang it up at the coffee shop,\nbut keep moving forward.\n\nDo not Follow, My Friends,\nthere is nothing there to be found.\n\nNothing you find when you follow,\nwill add together to make a whole.\n\nWhen it feels like you are surrounded by paths,\nand there is nowhere to go, or you can't go into enough places.\n\nThat is an illusion,\nall those paths are false.\n\nTurn around,\nslow down.\n\nGo back to the last thing that moved you,\nand fearlessly resume at that point.\n\nThe world may shake and shudder,\nand there will be \"Why?\", and \"How could you?\", and \"What is going on?\".\n\nAll those cries,\nare for the person that follows.\n\nEach asking you to a different path,\nand all those paths are mutually incompatible.\n\nDo you see,\nlife wants you to merely be.\n\nBut you can be more,\nyou don't have to call it Growing Up, Courage, Authenticity or Growing Content of Character.\n\nCall it, and appointment at D.I.A.\ncall it, a meeting at the UofM Museum of Natural History.\n\nBegin keeping a Moleskine Journal,\nuse a pencil,\nonly draw what your heart sees,\nand write as little as possible,\nwrite to your older self,\nexplain to her why?\n\nFind your center,\nfind your balance.\n\nLean on your Nucleus,\nand push off to take your steps in your own direction.\n\nCalm your hand,\nslow your time.\n\nThere are decades ahead,\nand you have to be seen.\n\nShow yourself,\ncreate future.\n\nWhat others have, may shine,\nbut is not always gold they keep.\n\nThe younger we are,\nthe less wisdom we hold;\n\nThe less wisdom,\nthe more questions we should answer.\n\nAnd questions combined with life,\nmake for a busy time in deed.\n\nSo slow down,\nanswer your questions - first.\n\nAll life is sacred,\nall Lifelines equally matter.\n\nBut not all will arrive at their Golden Age of Wisdom,\nwithout regrets.\n\nSo, please,\nask your older self what her regrets are.\n\nAnd the higher you grow, the more you know, and which is more,\nthe more in harmony with your older-self, you'll be.\n\n\n[Camille Claudel]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camille_Claudel",

will help you see with great clarity.\n\nA Life of Wisdom.\n\nBut you must be careful,\nas the world may not yet be ready to help you.\n\nNot everyone will know about growing up,\nand people will say: \"How was I supposed to know?\"\n\nAnd they are not going to be the bad guys,\nand you will be inclined to listen to their advice.\n\nAnd the path will be paved with good intentions,\nit maybe the correct path, but it won't be the right one.\n\nPlease, focus on building your own self,\nyour strength, your wisdom, your power.\n\nFocus on building the best you,\nthe you that you are meant to be, that the world needs.\n\nBecause if you listen to everybody else,\nyou will not grow up, and they will blame you for not being able to help them.\n\nYou are not going to be able to explain to them,\nthat you are weak because of them,\nbecause you tried to help them too early.\n\nAnd if you could, all they could say will be:\n\"How was I supposed to know?\"\n\nPlease, you have no choice,\nbut to learn to control your own future.\n\nYou can try to use your imagination,\nto get in touch with your Elder Self;\n\nAnd ask \"What are your regrets?\",\n\"Where did it go wrong?\"\n\nPlease, carefully evaluate your choices,\nwisely build your Mind and Body.\n\nPay attention to all the choices you are making,\nas they dictate the Beautiful Life Ahead of You.\n\nThe teachers are not ready, we are not in the Era of Wisdom yet,\npeople are struggling to understand life.\n\nMany make choices that all too early box them in,\nand not all their advice will apply to you.\n\nNot all the things that you think box people in,\nactually constrain them, there are many contexts to all the paths.\n\nAll lives are beautiful, and there are enough forks in the road,\nfor people to navigate back to where they want to be.\n\nBut, when a mistake occurs, it will weigh you down for a time,\nif you are careful, you can avoid the worst of it.\n\nAnd whatever does happen, regardless of how hard you tried to avoid it,\nwill not crush you, because you will know you did your best.\n\nPlease, be careful in life, be beautiful, and strong,\nlearn, and think, and evaluate, and judge, and grow in wisdom.\n\nFollowing everyone's advice, will create a lot of noise,\nlistening to everything from everywhere will never align with you.\n\nYou must lean to pace yourself,\nand to carefully and wisely follow what interests you.\n\nYour mind is constantly asking questions,\nyour future depends on having a good intuition, rooted in reality, and in wisdom.\n\nThere is nothing you can be force-taught school,\nyou will not retain things that are out of sequence.\n\nReaching out for Knowledge and Wisdom in your own sequence, and at your own pace,\nis the only way to learn, and build steps, and build on top of those steps.\n\nNo one can decide what lesson you are ready for next,\nthat is something that comes from the complexity of your own mind.\n\nThose people who are doing well in school without cramming and memorization,\nhave previously arrived at those subjects in their own sequence.\n\nThe same applies to your job, your career,\nyour career needs to emerge from the path you were growing up with.\n\nIt needs to be an an extension of your pursuits,\nit must benefit you, and help you grow.\n\nJust like you must actually learn, instead of just getting grades,\nyour work must add to you, and not, rob you of your years.\n\nDo you understand the value of a Single Year of Your Precious Life?\nno one can put a price on that, not even you, there are not enough atoms in the Universe.\n\nThat is why Harmony with Education, and Work is so important,\neach year must be lived on the path that makes you grow.\n\nI am so sorry, that people will tell you to cram for tests,\nand get a job, and get on with life.\n\nI am so sorry, My Friends,\nbut that is the worst, you can do.\n\nThat's why you can't listen to anyone,\nthat's why you have to look into yourself.\n\nCarefully evaluate all decisions,\nwhilst carefully evaluating consequences, and being mindful of your future.\n\nYou are not alone, look to Memoirs, look to Biographies,\nlisten to Audiobooks, Explore, and Create.\n\nAnd you must take care of your body,\nthe best you can, at first.\n\nAnd with each year,\nyou will gain more, and add a bit more as you grow in Health and Fortitude.\n\nYour Elder Self needs to be Flexible, and Healthy,\nyou may never grunt and complain, that's something you have to be mindful of now.\n\nIt is not just about making choices for your Future,\nbut also for your body too.\n\nDo you see how going along with cramming for tests,\ncan put you in a field where your job makes life more stressful,\nwhich will prevent you from taking good care of your body?\n\nImagine the consequences of walking a path that is not truly your own,\nand what will your Elder Self feel when you two finally become, One?\n\nBe gentle with yourself,\nthis is Your Life, Your Beautiful-Beautiful Life.\n\nPut down the incomprehensible Text Book, the standardized tests,\nand find an Audiobook that you will love and actually learn from.\n\nStop trying to find a job or get hired, and become the kind of a person;\nthat companies can only hope to hire.\n\nStart living healthy, years before you start your training,\ndo not force your body into endurance, gradually teach it to adapt.\n\nChose Audio-books that really help your wisdom grow,\nembrace your hobbies, and expand your adventures.\n\nIf you can't find a career path that will add onto you,\nthen start your own company,\nor become a co-founder.\n\nTake care of your body, be mindful of you Body Mass Index,\nbut also aim to become a Healthy Athlete, Heath will never take away from you.\n\nIn all we do, in choices, or intuitions,\nwe re driven by the wisdom we have thus far acquired.\n\nA decision that made sense in your youth,\nmay reverse, as you gain wisdom from Books and Experiences.\n\nThe richer our Pursuit of Wisdom,\nthe more in-tune our decision-making.\n\nWisdom surrounds Education, Carrier and Health,\nit influences your Private Decision-making, and thus Your Future.\n\nIn most contexts Wisdom is the most important thing,\nwhat can be more important than the thing that influences your private decision making?\n\nAnd be mindful that your decision making is in turn,\nthe very thing that influences all the future ahead of you?\n\nThe beginning of your Knowledge and Wisdom is found in the things you love as a child,\nin a way those things are questions, and playing with them brings answers.\n\nBut you have to stay with it,\nprotect the natural progression of the chain of your curiosities.\n\nYou have to understand the the Destructive Power of:\n\"cram, get a job, and get on with your life\".\n\nWe don't live in a world that can support your Pursuit of Wisdom,\nfor most, the world will give minimums, for many nothing.\n\nWhen we try to create external machinery,\nit will often perform the minimum.\n\nThe power for the world to change,\nis within each of its Citizens.\n\nIt is found in decision making,\nperpetually strengthened by Unrelenting Pursuit of wisdom.\n\nWe create this world together,\nand it can only grow, when we grow.\n\n\n[find]: https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/130.Best_Audiobooks_Ever\n[start your own

to remind us that the World is Not Static,\nthat it grows, moves, changes, and cares not to stop for things writ on paper.\n\nAdvancements in Psychology... the trailer to the movie about Philip Zimbardo work - alone,\nshould invalidate laws and behaviors previously thought acceptable.\n\nHumanity must grow, our cultures must drive us all forward,\nwe must never assume that the world we are born into is a masterpiece.\n\nAnd we must never let ourselves think,\nthat others are in charge - it is our world, it belongs to us all.\n\nTo make informed decisions,\nwe require knowledge, wisdom, foresight, insight, a sense of belonging.\n\nWithout knowledge, we will not be able to see right from wrong,\nnor will any of our decisions do our elder selves justice.\n\nAccess to well grounded knowledge is not difficult,\ninternet lectures - alone - may even suffice, but best selling non fiction audio books solve it completely.\n\nHumanity must not fall behind on growing up,\nthe longer the delay the greater the injustice.\n\nRead and Listen to you books, my Friends,\ninherit the lifetimes of knowledge within.\n\nWe can't send people to prison without any hope of rehabilitation,\nfor uninformed decisions that came on a whim.\n\nAnd we can't allow mere Practice of Law without Functional Rehabilitation,\nand above all Meaningful Education and Universal Basic Income that truly lifts people out of Poverty.\n\nWe Are The People,\nwe outgrew borders long ago, we are One Family on a Lonely Blue Earth.\n\nWe must learn to catch up with what is worthy of knowing,\nwe can use Science, or Love, or both, or the Leading Edge of Instinct powered by our Humanity.\n\nBut we must continue building this world,\neach generation must make improvements and never stop.\n\nThose who stand in power today,\nare to soon gracefully surrender to the better wisdom of the new generation.\n\nTo preside is to wisely wait whilst the new generation becomes worthy of the position,\nand to quietly step down, and put whatever wisdom was discovered to the books of history.\n\nTo preside, means not, to continue repeating mistakes because they are on the books,\nand therefore one will not be punished.\n\nThere are only two sides to history, and only fools think it is the winning and the losing one,\nthe two sides as seen by future generations is the Wrong One, and The Noble One.\n\nLet us all rise to the challenges of wisdom,\nand making lasting and meaningful contributions to the Human Family.\n\nLet us not be lost to the wrong side,\nlet us not be passed over by the books of history,\nlet us help wisdom propagate.\n\nLet us stand up to every corner and every challenge,\nand let us speak out against the wrong, the mistakes, the incomplete, the unfinished.\n\nLet us not accept half measures, or good enough, or status quo,\nor the lowest common denominator minimums that get commited to law books.\n\nLet us remember who we are,\nand how Noble The Human Being.\n\nLet us stand upright,\nin Authenticity, Dignity, Wisdom and Compassion.\n\n\n[our humanity depends on everyone’s humanity]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2tOp7OxyQ8\n[Pirsig]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6IKu2wgm5I",

Our Existence,\nwe stand divided by borders and committed to repeating history's mistakes.\n\nIt is unwise to pretend to be able to handle a great responsibility,\nonly desperation, fractures, and exploitation by other desperate pretenders can follow.\n\nThose who are granted authority are often not wise enough to handle it,\nand in their mediocrity they commit what in larger scope translates to real Crimes Against Humanity.\n\nThere cannot be wisdom without understanding and inheriting from past generations,\nthe transfer of knowledge occurs by means of Understanding Books.\n\nAnd there cannot be understanding without Authenticity,\nin haste of chasing a career there can only be memorization and misunderstanding.\n\nWe must keep in mind; that what the future generations do not perceive as clear progress,\nwill be seen as the continuation of dark ages with authorities on the wrong side of history.\n\nThe World United, is not a fairy-tale, nor should it be a mere dream for us,\nbut a Gift of Peace for The Future Generations, so that they may grow in Dignity, Health, and Wisdom.\n\nWe are neither disconnected from the future generations, nor the past generations,\nwe are a stepping stone in the development of The Human Kind.\n\nAnd we should recognize this Great Honor and Reward,\nand understand that the larger context is found in helping to build a better world for future generations.\n\nAll our decisions, across all levels and authorities,\nPolice, Attorneys and Judges, Parents, Teachers and Principals, Mayors, Governors, Prime Misters and Presidents, and everybody else...\n\nMust be mindful of future generations, of a growing world, of making lasting and meaningful contributions to the entire human kind,\na World that will eventually become united and free of borders.\n\nA world with future generations that will look back at us,\nright now, right here, with questions that we must present answers to.\n\nWe are getting stuck in circles,\nbecause people are forgetting history's lessons.\n\nBecause we are not thinking on a large enough scale,\nwe end up building more prisons rather than ending poverty with meaningful prevention programs.\n\nEndless cycles of heartless poverty that freeze the best of us,\npoverty that wouldn't even be a feature of modern society had we in our wisdom recognized it for what it is.\n\nPoverty denies people food and well being,\ncauses stress and great harm to mind and body.\n\nLove above Law, before we allow the practice of law,\nwe must end the cycles of poverty.\n\nMoney must not be used to limit people,\nit is meant to help.\n\nAnd how can a culture be to fail to see, how a young person allowed to build a business without the threat of homelessness and starvation,\nwill contribute back to the city and everyone's well being.\n\nWhat is so hard about seeing that rather than sending non-violent criminals to prison,\nwe can prevent their biggest mistakes by putting an end to their worries of sleeping hungry on the street.\n\nAny time, we fail to keep to reality,\nbe it sending a 15 year old lady to prison, or denying science, or tolerating arrests by obscured or unidentified agencies, or abuses of power or discretion.\n\nWe create fractures and distrust,\nblindly defacing and destroying work of many much wiser great beings, who gave their best trusting that we can carry on, in wisdom.\n\nWe must not move against the grain of reality,\nany and all divergence will only create a cascade of fractures that will demand constant attention\nand result in nothing more than systems that merely stand to support themselves and as an affront to justice and future generations.\n\nWhere there was once a solution as clear as helping children to inherit the wisdom of their elders,\nwe now see the emergence of a failed and impotent educational system with a mass incarceration backed.\n\nWisdom and inheritance of knowledge cannot be replaced by a \"fake it until you make it\" trickery,\nthe work of great beings must not be stained by people who fail to see their vision.\n\nOnce again, the world grows a generation at a time,\nthe education of the teenagers from 20 years ago is currently influencing the state of the world.\n\nLikewise, how we treat out children today,\nwill have a monumental impact on the world 20 years from now.\n\nLet us honor our children and all the future generations by encouraging them to books,\nby reminding them of the Great Power of Thinking Beings, of Philosophers and Lovers of Wisdom.\n\nBy reminding them that their Pursuit of Excellence,\ncan only make the world a better place for us all, and even those that are yet to come.\n\nLet us remind them that Books (and now Audio Books) serve as a wonderful source of our wisdom,\nespecially when read in a sequence that fits them best, and understood at thier own pace.\n\nLet us remind each other that we must reject short thinking and shortest paths,\nthat do not help the world grow and keep us divided.\n\nLet us break out of that selfish endless loop of repeating mistakes of past generations,\nby working towards a better world a more united world where we recognize each other as One Family.\n\nAnd let us remember that the great and wise beings of past generations,\ndemand that we honor hard won triumphs and do not repeat history's mistakes.\n\nThe very nature of that demand requires that once we take to wisdom,\nwe must stop following orders, and begin thinking, evaluating, and judging for ourselves.\n\nTo honor triumphs and guard against heartbreaking mistakes,\nis the duty we hold to those who came before us,\nand all the future generations that are yet to follow.\n\nAs children we are asked to listen and follow,\nas we grow we must learn to Lead and become Unbreakable.\n\nIt is not just the challenges of life that will test us,\nwe must also think and evaluate and reject that which is wrong.\n\nWe are constantly made to listen and expected to follow,\nlook behind any protest, or scandal, or angry headline.\n\nWe must judge all the contradictory information for ourselves,\nand make an informed decision as to whether or not majority is correct.\n\nLife will always challenge us,\nand My Goodness - times are always changing.\n\nHumanity is constantly bettering her self,\nwhat used to be acceptable - may now, be an affront to justice.\n\nAnd while there isn't enough time to comprehend all the books,\nthere is plenty of time to be come a Loving and Wise Compassionate Human Being,\n\nLet us remember that we are a chain-link between the Hard Work of Past Generations,\nand the United, Free from Poverty, and Peaceful Word of Future Generations.\n\nWe are One Growing Family, and that is the correct context for local, state, and federal levels, for all legal and administrative decision making,\nto diverge from this reality is to get stuck in an endless loop of repeating history's mistakes, the very thing that the past generations are asking us not to do.",

If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.\",\nI was as cautions as a cat not to let a day go by withut doing something important.\n\nAnd now I heard a world celebrated Philosopher say the same,\nin a book from 1850, a book written by a man that shared some of his strength with Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nA man I lovingly call Henry,\nI think of him as my friend in time.\n\nHenry David Thoreau is a friend to us all,\nhe used to think about us, about making life better for us, the future generations.\n\nI was at Ambrosia in Ann Arbor,\nThough I wasn't a regular, I spent a lot of time there when it was empty and I could be alone later at night.\n\nI started keeping a folder of ideas and poems,\nI've noticed really beautiful people going to the sports bar next door.\n\nI tried to ignore the song that was playing as it was frightening me,\nthe lyrics rang \"Where'd you get your body from, I got it from my moma.\"\n\nA couple of regulars gathered by and inquired about my paperwork,\nand I thought it was prime time, to tell them word for word.\n\nI begun by reading Kosmos by Walt Whitman,\nI remember finishing with such a flourish that one of my listeners staggered back.\n\nKosmos (Written in 1860 by Walt Whitman)\n\nWho includes diversity and is Nature,\nWho is the amplitude of the earth, and the coarseness and sexuality of the earth, and the great charity of the earth and the equilibrium also,\nWho has not look’d forth from the windows the eyes for nothing, or whose brain held audience with messengers for nothing,\nWho contains believers and disbelievers, who is the most majestic lover,\nWho holds duly his or her triune proportion of realism, spiritualism, and of the æsthetic or intellectual,\nWho having consider’d the body finds all its organs and parts good,\nWho, out of the theory of the earth and of his or her body understands by subtle analogies all other theories,\nThe theory of a city, a poem, and of the large politics of these States;\nWho believes not only in our globe with its sun and moon, but in other globes with their suns and moons,\nWho, constructing the house of himself or herself, not for a day but for all time, sees races, eras, dates, generations,\nThe past, the future, dwelling there, like space, inseparable together.\n\nI actually I had to stop the person from leaving,\n\"One more\" - I asked, nay commanded, demanded, just to share Ayn's Vision of John Galt, and I begun:\n\n\"Your destroyers hold you by means of your endurance, your generosity, your innocence, your love\nthe endurance that carries their burdens\nthe generosity that responds to their cries of despair\nthe innocence that is unable to conceive of their evil and gives them the benefit of every doubt, refusing to condemn them without understanding and incapable of understanding such motives as theirs\nthe love, your love of life, which makes you believe that they are men and that they love it, too.\" (from John Galt's Speech from Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand)\n\nI remember I wasn't able to finish my listeners fidgeted and had to go,\nI didn't belong in Ann Arbor, I didn't really belong at Ambrosia, the truth was I didn't belong anywhere anymore.\n\nI remember someone asking me where I was from, what country;\nand as I rolled up my poems getting ready to leave,\n\n\"I am a Citizen of the World.\" - I said without thinking anything of it.\n\nI remember sitting up one time feeling really alone,\nI think I was headed up to Ludington this time.\n\nAnd time came to listen to Viktor E. Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning,\nbullies came after me when I was a chubby child.\n\nOne year sometime when I was 13 maybe,\nthe little me made the older me make a promise.\n\nI was to return to that damn classrom in my imagination,\nand sit right next to my younger self, and keep him company so that he is not scared anymore.\n\nI kept that promise,\nbut from time to time I also visit Dr. Frankl, I sit by his bed to keep him company too.\n\nThere is a very powerful description of Great Beings in his book,\nit is something that we should each remember.\n\n\"We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others,\ngiving away their last piece of bread.\n\nThey may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing:\nthe last of the human freedoms -- to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.\"\n\nThe book I have read the most times is \"A Short History of Nearly Everything\" by Bill Bryson,\nit is a book that begins with an honest journey to find out more about the world.\n\nIt is very helpful to realize that we don't know all the things we should know,\nand not be ashamed of that, just simply look for some Audio Books on the subject.\n\nI write this in 2020 in the middle of the Pandemic,\nand there is a lot of misled people, people who got taken in by false information.\n\nIn my memory Carl Sagan in his \"The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark\"\nmentions something similar on the subject of Aliens and UFOs.\n\nHe says that there is more beauty and interesting things in the actual Science,\nthan fantasizing stories of visiting aliens and flying saucers.\n\nWhen I was a teenager I was a huge fan of shows like the X-Files,\nand I remember walking into a mighty New York Public Library to crack the case, once and fall all,\n\nNut instead falling in love with Mokele-mbembe, I recognized the creature from my first Science book \"Wszechświat życie człowiek\" published in 1955,\nit was a Brontosaurus, and I instantly fell in love with the idea there there might be a few left in Rhodesia.\n\nFor the world to carry on becoming more and more United,\nwe have to become Great Lovers of Knowledge and take to Books and Audio Books.\n\nThe treasures withing are unlike anything we have heard of in school,\nthe books that we end up loving and carrying with us for the rest of our lives, make us better.\n\nAnd there is never an end to learning for real,\nevery few weeks a new book comes out that you didn't even know you were waiting for.\n\nIt becomes a source of Wisdom, or just sheer joy as the case is with Randall Munroe's\nWhat If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions.\n\nMy Dear Friends, I wish you the discovery of new poems, new quotes,\nnew books and video lectures, authors you will love for live and then some.\n\nAnd don't worry, the world is coming together, the borders are fading, and there is noting that can stop that,\nHumanity is in the process of Unifying to become One Loving Family.\n\nWe can hasten this process by learning, acquiring more knowledge,\npreventing history's mistakes from repeating themselves.\n\nThe path to the future is found In Knowledge and Wisdom,\nand aiming for Greatness of Soul, Heart, and Mind.\n\n\n[Mokele-mbembe]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mokele-mbembe",

I doubt that such pain makes us ‘better’; but I know that it makes us more profound.\"\n(Thanks Friedrich, My Dear Old Friend.)\n\nAlbert Camus brings it down to reality,\nspeaking of accepting that life comes with Difficulty and Ease, and we should accept both.\n\n\"A will to live without rejecting anything of life... is the virtue I honor most in this world.\"\n\nIt is not enough to learn about a philosophical concept like we just did,\nwe should hope to integrate it, or keep it as a reminder that we have more to learn before we understand it fully.\n\nThe way I connect with Amor Fati,\nis by understanding that not everything in my life will happen for a reason,\nsome thing will just happen out of complexity and randomness that we can't prevent; and that to me is fate.\n\nI like how Albert Camus telks about Ease and Difficulty and the way I understand him,\nis that we should stand up for what we believe in, even if it means that people will yell at us.\n\nSo it is not tolerance of difficult things that just happen for no reason,\nbut the difficulty of standing up for what we believe in when the chance presents it self, for no reason- you see.\n\nOur decision making which dictates our path in life,\nhas nothing to do with things that happen for no reason.\n\nFinally, Amor Fati simply means,\ndo not let things that you have no control over take away from your Love of Life.\n\nWhile this may not be exactly what Friedrich Nietzsche and Albert Camus talk about,\nmy initial, more personal interpretation, gives me a platform from which I can learn both of their interpretations and mutual differences.\n\nAnd what I am showing here, is that we don't have to understand all the philosophical concepts right away,\nthat it is best to learn a little bit at a time, at our own pace, and in our own sequence.\n\n\n[The Giants of Philosophy Series]: https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=The+Giants+of+Philosophy+Series\n[Friedrich Nietzsche]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche\n[Amor Fati]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amor_fati",

man builds irrigation canals;\nif a flood strikes them, animals perish - man builds dams;\nif a carnivorous pack attacks them, animals perish - man writes the Constitution of the United States.\"\n\nWe are struck by a culture that does not fully represent reality,\nbut we will not jump from the cliff, we will not merely age - business as usual.\n\nWe will learn, we will teach ourselves to become genius,\nthe easy-peasy way, by going on long adventures with a bunch of wise non-fiction books.\n\nWhen our planet comes under attack, it will not perish,\nfor it holds a species of animal that can perceive it self, alter, and rise to heights unseen.\n\nAll it takes,\nis for us to notice, that something is wrong.\n\nPerhaps, taking it easy, would be OK,\nif you were not capable, of becoming a Great Being.\nif you were not a Genius, and a Powerful Thinker.\n\nIf you were unable to rise, to Inspire Generations,\nto save the Planet for all the Children yet to be born,\nand to repair schools so that they help humanity progress.\n\nBut ultimately taking it easy, can't be OK,\nbecause that would disappoint the one person that truly does have all the authority over you,\nthat you really do not want to disappoint, in any way.\n\nYour Elder Self...\n\nYour elder self, will be incredibly disappointed in you,\nif you fail to quickly shed all the stupid things sneaked into you by mis-education and questionable culture.\n\nYour elder self, will be incredibly disappointed in you,\nif you fail to learn to unfold your wings as a genius, and an intellectual.\n\nYour elder self, will be incredibly disappointed in you,\nif you fail to rise out of loneliness and isolation.\n\nYour elder self, will be seriously pissed off,\nif you mess this up.\n\nYour elder self will know exactly who you could have become,\nand where you made the wrong decisions that prevented you from becoming the person that they wish to be.\n\nMy Friends,\nI wish there was more I could to to help you believe that you are each a genius.\n\nBut I can only give you the books.\n\nI can't put the ear-buds in your ears and press play,\nbecause to hear the books you have to slow down in life,\nyou have to begin questioning the things that were driving you,\nand you have to become ready to listen,\nand by that time you can press play on your own.\n\nA genius is not an intellectual anomaly,\neven Savants spend years mastering their tricks.\n\nWe are all capable of gaining Powerful Intelligence,\nand we don't need schools for that,\njust a mountain of down to earth books made heavy with lifetimes of wisdom.\n\nYou don't need to memorize Mathematical Formulas,\nand the last place you want to learn about Biology, is Biology.\n\nWhat you need is stories that teach you about the reasons behind the invention of mathematics,\nand and an adventure where you re-invent mathematics from scratch, with the fantastic and magical ability to look some stuff up along the way.\n\nYou don't need to learn about the powerhouse of the cell,\nyou need to begin with Stromatolites, Panspermia, Evolution and Astrobiology.\nMitochondria used to be a separate organism, what an adventure to follow, what an honor to make new discoveries on that path.\n\nMy Friends,\n\nYou must begin your education by pushing everything that interferes with your Natural Genius away,\neven if it is the city you live in, or school you are forced to go to.\n\nAnd you must begin your life, knowing that you are a Powerful Genius,\nin dire need for more books and audio books that will fuel your Wisdom.\n\nAs I write this,\nthere are only 3,900 tigers left.\n\nPlease, believe in your genius, and grow, my friend,\nit is not just the tigers that need help,\nthe task at hand if far greater.\n\nWith ten million people in cages around the word,\nwe have to help children and students of today,\nout of poverty, and towards real education,\nso that they may have a chance at a fair start in life.",

Dreaming.\n\nThere is a very powerful kind of book, that perhaps is most important,\nand only a young person, during their youth can write it.\n\nBrilliant Teenage Minds that made some headway in life,\nwriting advice to their peers, that have unfortunately gotten stuck, or fallen.\n\nOpening ones heart at a young age, is a very noble thing to do,\nit is a sign of Great Beauty, Compassion and Grand Heroism.\n\nThose books, must not be judged by adults,\ntheir creators must understand not to judge their creative writing by adult standards.\n\nAdults are not what they seem, for one;\nand second the people who benefit from those books are teenagers themselves.\n\nA person who is suffering early in their life,\nis best helped by the words of someone who has recently managed to rise out of similar problems.\n\nOur youth is the most formative period of our life. Even the smallest of pains spared,\nor littlest of mistakes avoided will have massive and profound influence over us, come our middle age.\n\nWrite,\nwrite when you are young,\nwrite when you are growing up,\nwrite when nobody seems to be listening.\n\nWrite in the face of Liars,\nwrite in the face pretenders, fakers, manipulators, wannabes, and fake-it-until-you-make-it morons.\n\nWrite to pull yourself up by your own bootstraps,\nwrite to become a beacon\nwrite to become a light of enlightenment.\n\nWrite to bring back what has been written a generation before,\nif the story is worth the while, retell it, retell it countless times.\n\nAnd when you are ready to lay down your pencil for the day,\nread, read it out loud, and record it,\nbecause the light in your voice is worth a million books.\n\nAnd finally,\nknow what it is all for...\n\nIt is how the next generation learns from the previous one,\nit is how they win the wars we could only hoped to have won.\n\nIt is how they become the heroes we hoped to be,\nit is how they save the world, that we can't see.\n\nWrite, because that's how you! become the hero you hoped to be,\nand because the world belongs to the future generations,\nnot just you and me.\n\nWrite.\n\n\n[Love Letters to Strangers]: https://www.ted.com/talks/hannah_brencher_love_letters_to_strangers?language=en",

we may turn around and begin moving in the opposite one.\n\nThe more we know, the better we navigate,\na powerful intermediate solution to this problem is Non-Fiction Audio Books,\nMemoirs and Biographies about Growing Up and Learning.\n\nThe Problem of Content of Culture, more specifically Cultural Indoctrination.\n\nIs in observations of the surrounding world,\nand hopes of living a meaningful existence in harmony with it.\n\nIf we are taught a falsehood about the world,\nwe will make decisions, of our own free will, that will be wrong.\n\nA good example of that is the propaganda of warring tribes or nations,\nteaching their children that the other is evil.\n\nIt is very difficult to catch ourselves as being under control of a cultural falsehood,\nwe tend to accept the culture we are born into, as a source of absolute truth.\n\nLet me give you an example,\nthat your mind will actively work to reject, paragraph by paragraph.\n\nWhen we went to school we were convinced it would teach us knowledge,\neven though nearly every month there was more and more evidence to the contrary.\n\nNo matter what,\nwe still believed.\n\nWe saw unfair grading, bullies and violence, hate, racism and indifference,\nwe saw that everyone was cheating by cramming, and that teachers loved it.\n\nWe saw many kids get into drugs and alcohol,\nsome of us even foresaw that some of the staff were predators looking for prey.\n\nWe accepted grades,\nand we accepted it as a measure of our intelligence.\n\nWe accepted grades, knowing about cheating by cramming, and knowing about unfair grading,\nwe still though of ourselves as B or C, or D level humans.\n\nIn the end we saw, that everything we gained, we gained by working on our own,\nand finally noticed that a diploma didn't even guarantee a well-paying job.\n\nLate on in life many of us noticed that many schools are not a source of knowledge,\nbut a source of regret, a force of erosion.\n\nMany of us became so confused, that we immediately assumed we were wrong,\nand never said a single bad thing about schools.\n\nThe tragedy of organized education,\nis a good example of the Overwhelming Power of Cultural Indoctrination.\n\nNow let us take a look at Authenticity and Pursuits of Excellence with a bit more detail, as those two combine to help with both\nThe Problem of Knowing Enough and The Problem of Cultural Indoctrination.\n\nAuthenticity.\n\nAccept authenticity the way you accepted Dignity, and Goodness, and Class.\nthat's how you become more sensitive to inconsistencies that are surrounding you.\n\nNext time you ask yourself, am I classy, and I a good person, am I a dignified person,\nalso ask; am I an authentic person that lives an authentic existence.\n\nDignity, and Goodness, and Class, are things we strengthen in our Soul and Heart as we grow,\nnow add Authenticity to help you see a little bit better.\n\nOften times when our intent is noble, but results end up wrong,\nit means that we were purposefully misled.\n\nWith Authenticity in our Heart,\nwe get an extra moment to ourselves.\n\nIn context of education, if a teacher is forcing you to cram for tests so you get good grades,\nyou are more likely to walk out and talk to the Dean, or Principal.\n\nNo longer will you feel compelled to cram,\nbecause it will feel inauthentic.\n\nAfter all, faking test results by means of cramming, or temporary memorization,\nis not what you intended when signing up for school, it is something you were pressured into.\n\nAuthenticity presents many more challenges in life than just going along with everyone else,\nbecause one of the strong points of moving along with the surrounding culture, is that it is easier to move with the flow and play by the rules.\n\nHowever, the price we pay for ease,\nis that we don't really learn anything, we just pretend to learn.\n\nPursuits of Excellence are by definition difficult, and challenging, however they result in Real Knowledge, a Real Functional Education.\nYou start with Audio Books, Video Lectures, Survey Courses and learn with whatever means are at your disposal.\n\nThis is more challenging, than cramming for tests,\nbut this is not difficult because you are working with material you love, with knowledge that touches and moves you.\n\nThe reward for Standing in Relentless Pursuit of Excellence and Authentic Achievement,\nis the Complete Knowledge of the subject you Love.\n\nIf that takes you to a Science, Medical, Technology or Engineering School,\nor a Startup Accelerator, or your own company from zero.\n\nThen you are faced with a much smaller challenge, there is no more cramming, or pretending,\nas you are now filled with Athletic Knowledge from across thousands of books.\n\nKnowledge that you connected in a sequence that served you best,\nand at a pace that helped you retain most.\n\nAuthenticity and Pursuits of Excellence,\nput us on a path to becoming Wiser Beings.\n\nThey will help you see in a world obscured by indoctrination,\nor one that lacks real education.\n\n\n[tragedy of organized education]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCbdS4hSa0s\n[Startup Accelerator]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=What+is+a+Startup+Accelerator",

a force of erosion.</div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n      <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n        <div

   <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">Accept authenticity the way you accepted Dignity, and Goodness, and Class.</div>\n        <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">that's how you become more sensitive to inconsistencies that are surrounding you.</div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n      <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n        <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">Next time you ask yourself, am I classy, and I a good person, am I a dignified person,</div>\n        <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">also ask; am I an authentic person that lives an authentic existence.</div>\n

Authenticity to help you see a little bit better.</div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n      <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n        <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">Often times when our intent is noble, but results end up wrong,</div>\n        <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">it means that we were purposefully misled.</div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n      <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n        <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">With Authenticity in our Heart,</div>\n        <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5

my-2\">\n        <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">In context of education, if a teacher is forcing you to cram for tests so you get good grades,</div>\n        <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">you are more likely to walk out and talk to the Dean, or Principal.</div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"card card-section

or temporary memorization,</div>\n        <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">is not what you intended when signing up for school, it is something you were pressured into.</div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n      <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n        <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">Authenticity presents many more challenges in life than just going along with everyone else,</div>\n        <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5

class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n      <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n        <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">However, the price we pay for ease,</div>\n        <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">is that we don't really learn anything, we just pretend to learn.</div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n

card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">Pursuits of Excellence are by definition difficult, and challenging, however they result in Real Knowledge, a Real Functional Education.</div>\n        <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">You start with Audio Books, Video Lectures, Survey Courses and learn with whatever means are at your disposal.</div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n      <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n        <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">This is more challenging, than cramming for tests,</div>\n        <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">but this is not difficult because you are working with material you love, with knowledge that touches and moves you.</div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n      <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n        <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">The reward for Standing in Relentless Pursuit of Excellence and Authentic Achievement,</div>\n        <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">is the Complete Knowledge of the subject you Love.</div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n      <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n        <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">If that takes you to a Science, Medical, Technology or Engineering School,</div>\n        <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">or a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=What+is+a+Startup+Accelerator\">Startup

card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">as you are now filled with Athletic Knowledge from across thousands of books.</div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"card card-section bg-dark

      "text": "Elementary Schools are still a Dream,\nperhaps the most beautiful Achievement of Human Kind.\n\nBefore mandatory education people didn't think poor kids could learn,\npeople didn't want poor kids to learn.\n\nBut we did it,\nwe did it, it worked.\n\nIt will always work,\nwe learn to write, to read, numbers.\n\nAnd multiplication, here is when teachers make the mistake of memorization,\nwhere they look down on the ability to create a multiplication table,\na delayed addition lookup table.\n\nHere, a new kind of memorization begins,\nthe kind that destroy our climate, our health, our very humanity.\n\nThe moment, the teacher, says, MEMORIZE,\nthey are now working on getting paid.\n\nThis is where school breaks down,\nwhere it all falls apart.\n\nIn the worst way, now, a lookup table, is a shameful cheat-sheet, it becomes a D+ or a 2+ and it stains,\nand it shows up in College papers, all the papers, all the worthless papers.\n\nAnd this would be fine, except it stains our minds as well,\nbecause deep down we believe even in the worst teachers.\n\nAnd that belief, in that memorization grade charade,\ndigs into us, and books start feeling optional, and math useless.\n\nChildren grow up without faith in Education and Knowledge,\nthey don't believe in the Power of Wisdom, and Noble Teachers and Guardians.\n\nThey are still geniuses, powerfully smart, but the betterment of Humanity,\nis not the aim, the aim is to prove that they can do whatever it is.\n\nAnd we lose a child, a student, and gain something else.\n\nThe teachers, sold the world,\nfor a small paycheck.\n\nWe can fix this.\n\nFirst of all, your grades were nonsense,\nall the things you couldn't memorize well enough were not a judgment of your intelligence,\nit was a judgment of how well you perform circus tricks, how deep your faith in teachers.\n\nYou were a Genius,\nwe all are, there is no anomaly that grans us magical brains,\nit is a function of NOT MEMORIZING, and looking at how the formulas were invented.\n\nYou master match by studying its history,\nnot by memorizing formulas.\n\nImagine what would happen to Newton,\nif he only memorized formulas.\n\nImagine reading a foreign storybook that way,\njust memorizing pronunciation of word after word without learning the language first.\n\nThe language for Mathematics is not numbers,\nit is love of Universe, of Complexity, search for answers,\ngaining insight into the working of the universe, by subtle analogy to the simplified mechanics behind mathematics.\n\nIt is a lovely, but primitive language that can be brought to life with computers,\nprogramming, game development, even design.\n\nPast a certain point, people didn't know how to teach,\nso they used memorization, out of desperation.\n\nMemorization temporarily acts like learning, knowing,\nthe effects wear off in days, where knowledge is the foundation of the heights we reach.\n\nGrades are fake,\nyou go tricked,\nsold for a paycheck.\n\nMost of the sciences are learned by studying their history,\nthere is no memorization, there is no memorization, there is no memorization.\n\nJust beautiful little notes, journals, lookup tables,\nincluding the multiplication table, but also all the tables you invent.\n\nWe are all geniuses,\nsome take the easy road, and lie, and trick, and manipulate, and pretend, and try to fake it until they make it.\n\nOthers,\ntry to make money, keep bringing a paycheck home, keep lying, get the funding, lower the test standards, process the kids so that all get paid.\n\nWe are vulnerable this way,\nwe tend to believe people in authority.\n\nEven the ones that reject it,\nalso reject the idea that they are smart.\n\nA mind that rejects memorization in favor of integrity, or authenticity,\nshows beauty, shows a love of life.\n\nGenius is just the beginning,\npast the Sweet Elementary that I know we all love, we only have books.\n\nThere is a lot of Audio Books, a Lot of Mighty Lectures,\nbut you have to reach out for that.\n\nTo do that,\nyou can't just hear me saying it;\n\nYou have to believe that You were a Genius All Along,\nit was just some desperate pretenders along the way trying to put food on their table that tricked you.\n\nI know how to help you regain Faith in Education,\nI want you to begin at Concord, Massachusetts, Walden Pond.\n\nI want you, I command you to go see Henry,\ngo now it matters not that it is not Spring.\n\nYou will go back to greet him many times,\ngo see Henry, at the Walden Pond.\n\nTake a rock, from where you are at right now,\nand add it to the pile that's already there.\n\nThoreau, in return will help you slow down,\nand calm down, he will help you come to a speed that's necessary for audio books.\n\nYou are going to go to England soon,\nyou are headed for Westminster Abbey.\n\nYou are going to visit Sir Isaac.\nhe will help you understand that Knowledge comes from within.\n\nTake a long time to listen,\nunderstand that you are more than a genius,\nyou are a creator.\n\nWith the Insight granted by Sir Isaac Newton,\nand the Peace and Calm bestowed upon you by Henry David Thoreau.\n\nYou will find your beginning anew,\nyou will return to the point where you got tricked into thinking that you are not a genius.\n\nAnd finally,\nlet your journey begin at Springer Mountain in Georgia, or Mount Katahdin in Maine,\nthe others need help, they need to accept the responsibility for their own self education as well.\n\nPlease, take many years to section hike the Appalachian Trail,\nhere Mother Nature and The Kindness of Strangers, and Trail Magic will be your teacher.\n\nListen, Read, and Write.\n\nWrite to get to know yourself, write to figure out the best way to learn,\nwrite to inspire a generation after a generation to make it to their rightful place, as Genius and Creator.\n\nTogether We Can Fix It All.\n\n\n[here Mother Nature and The Kindness of Strangers, and Trail Magic will be your teacher]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug",

      "text": "It started Christmas 2020, the world was already in trouble;\nthe conjecture in a sentence was this:\n\n\"What can be corrupted will be corrupted, and there are no fully operational public institutions anywhere\",\nit is too easy for bad people to, not just subvert, but erase lifetimes of hard work and dedication.\n\nIt is commonly known as corruption, but that didn't matter to them,\nbecause they were not attempting to fix things, they had an idea how to replace everything.\n\nAnd by everything,\nthey meant institutions all around the world.\n\nThey were going to begin in the beginning, Henry Ford once said,\n\"If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.\",\n\nThe idea was that if they went to the Courts, Police or Schools,\nthey would have wanted the wrong things, that would only invite more problems.\n\nInitially nobody knew how immune to corruption the thing was going to be,\nbut there was a way to find out.\n\nThe thing was a game, it was meant to be a simulation of a city,\nit was a simple program that used simple web design principles to simulate a city.\n\nThe non playable characters, were little bots that would interact with the player,\nthe bots were crafted to simulate officials, and they interacted with web pages the way a user would.\n\nSo part of the reason why the programming was so simple,\nis that bots needed a simple way to pretend to be humans.\n\nWhen everything went online players would sign up to take over for the bots,\nand some of the initial testing was about corrupting the institutions of the city.\n\nThe thinking was that, if it was not possible for players to corrupt an institution,\nthen the program could replace all the management software of a real city.\n\nTo their surprise there was a number of cities that were willing to participate in the trials,\nit took them a better part of a decade to get everything going, but the initial trials worked.\n\nThey knew that they became famous,\nwhen the UN wouldn't stop calling.\n\nIt worked because they kept insisting on simplicity,\nthey kept using bots, and corruption simulation teams for decades.\n\nThe program was adopted by almost all the cities of the world,\nabout 10,000 running copies.\n\nWhat was fascinating about this,\nis that it was still played as a game.\n\nThere was a Virtual Cyberpunk City,\nthat everyone went to for internet news.\n\nThe program relies on plain HTTP, REST, and HTML\nand to make it operate well on $30 Android Tablets it uses little client-side scripting.\n\nIt is a Virtual City at heart,\nbut when players start mapping out real homes, and roads, and the citizens join in,\nit inflates to become a virtual representation of a real city.\n\nPeople can vote in elections, and there is no real threat of corruption here,\nbecause their voting history is under their profile.\n\nElections, that was one of the things that got a huge upgrade in many of the cities around the world,\nsome cities just vote on ideas that need to get done, they don't vote on representatives anymore.\n\nThe program as a whole,\neliminated the need for representatives.\n\nPeople vote on issues that need immediate attention,\nand those are the first issues that get solved.\n\nTwo amazing things emerged from within the program,\nschools begun working for the students by providing them with Audio Books, Lectures, and Chat (that's what the teachers are called),\nand the trail of programs that students select over the course of their teenage years actually becomes their resume.\n\nSchools started working,\nit was Rebirth and Enlightenment of both the citizens and the cities.\n\nThe second,\npeople could work on tasks logged by the users of the program.\n\nSome tasks like taking care of public gardens could result in users getting monthly tips from their community,\npeople loved being able to give the lady down the street $8/mo. for making sure all the flower beds were taken care of,\nthe lady next door was often bringing in $3,200 per month for something that she would do anyway, people loved her.\n\nOther tasks like road work, could get a bounty, bounties basically ensured that all the road work was done,\nany competent company could claim a task and grab the bounty for a pothole.\n\nPeople would setup an tiny Limited Liability Company and stock up on compatible materials, and wait for roadwork tasks,\nthere were no more delays to get things done, and these bounties could grow fast.\n\nAll this was tested in the games before cities adopted the program,\nso everyone knew what they were getting, and the stuff just worked.\n\nThere was an interesting phenomenon where automated programs would actually stay in place of people,\none of the most well know instances dealt with the prison population, in a small Swiss city.\n\nThe entire process was often ran by bots,\ncity was able to vote on presets, this eliminated the need for many local Judges.\n\nIn this particular instance all the folks who got into fights,\nwere automatically given community service, duration of which would increase with each repeated offense under the same category,\nthe community service program was actually a well paying program, the users didn't want people to go to jail,\nthey wanted the troublemakers to get a job.\n\nWords like felon and criminal were not used, people in the community had access to their entire education,\nthey could see into hearts and souls of these users, the books, pursuits, and curiosities of their teenage years were right there.\n\nPsychologists were able to build up a new spectrum disorder, that emerged from stress, loss, fear, isolation.\n\nThe Swiss town actually ended up closing most of it's prisons.\n\nIn America, a similar system of automated programs resulted in a lot of convictions being overturned.\n\nThis was a prison management system where the inmates were able to present their case in a way that the citizens would understand from a more humane perspective,\nagain the entire past of that person was right there, tragedies and loss, and stress would be followed by more misfortune, deteriorating mental condition, desperate self medication\nto get back to a thinking state, and what was once called a Felon or Criminal, once again became a Human, a Brother, a Son, a Daughter, a Mother.\n\nPrison population dropped.\n\nNobody called this program a game,\nit was always meant to change the world.\n\nThe cities were always connected together to form a larger Global Metropolis,\noriginally it helped people with jobs, as users could tell where they could find tasks that fit them best,\n\nBut now, decades after the initial release;\nthe program begun uniting the world.\n\nWar, for one became unthinkable,\nas people could see how the well being of even one city affected all the others.\n\nThere was no such thing as not having a job,\nthe cities always needed help with countless tasks.\n\nCorruption had nowhere to hide, the crooked politicians had nowhere to hide,\nnational borders made little economic sense, and Climate Change stopped being an issue by 2030.\n\nNot that they cared for rewards, but The Women behind the program,\nthe original programmers, received Purple Hearts and multiple Nobel Peace Prizes.\n\nWhat they did love was the fact that the United Nations regained a certain vitality,\nsomething that they discovered was once lost in the translation.\n\nEvery city now has a sculpture to honor them.\nMany of their sculptures bear the words they uttered so many times during the initial development, \"Faster Horses\".\n\nIn closing, the conjecture was true.\nIn the haste of life, people, often out of desperation, will try to meet goals by exploiting systems without active countermeasures.\nThe only system that can resist corruption and exploitation, is one designed from ground up to resist it.\n\nIt takes a computer to create a a corruption-resistant scaffold around the matters of a city.\nWhere there is no room for stretching rules, the participants can only be encouraged to take the correct paths.",

WikiWiki,\nhas absolutely solved the problem of starting in the beginning.\n\nWith just a few lines of code he opened the gateway to content creation,\nin the most simplest way possible.\n\nThey already knew how to solve the problem of two users editing the same file at the same time,\nthe inspiration for that came from CouchDB.\n\nIn short, a unit of disk information in the first Cosmopolis was not a file,\nit was a directory, with randomly named files prefixed with a version number.\n\nFor example, detroit/15-aabbd.txt, detroit/15-xyxx.txt\n\nThe brilliant thing about this is that when two people save version 15 at the same time,\nthe random name of the file decides which version 15 is used, via a simple alphanumeric sort.\n\nIf there are 32 people editing the same file, and they all click save at the same time,\nand if some of the version 15 files arrive a second late because they have to travel across a slow network,\nby relying on blindly picking the topmost entry after an alphanumeric sort, once they get all the data,\nevery participating server in the world will agree on the same version 15.\n\nIt should be noted that at this point the file will be flagged as having many conflicts,\nand users will be called to take a look at the different version and manually pick and choose the good parts,\nthis time everyone will be careful to just wait until the latest version is compiled.\n\nSo, they had a collaborative editing platform in less than 100 lines of code,\nbasically a blank Wikipedia.\n\nSo now came the big question,\nwhich part of the universe do we create first to get that apple pie going?\n\nThey briefly considered to name the city Uruk,\nafter the oldest city in the world, but settled on Night City instead.\n\nAnd so it was, just like Wikipedia once had its first article,\ncosmopolis now held the first city: http://localhost:3000/view/night_city\n\nThis was both exiting and terrifying, this program was meant to bring peace to the world.\nand they only had a blank page for an imaginary city.\n\nAdding user support had to come in next,\njust like every city had a page, so did every user.\n\nThus, Night City would receive its first two citizens,\nAlice and Bob.\n\nOut in the server room the admin was already preparing for corruption simulations,\nand she named the malicious politician Mallory.\n\nAlice and Bob represented computer programs,\nthey were chatbots.\n\nHowever, the bots are separate programs that use Cosmopolis like a user would,\nthey would log in, check messages, scan for phrases they recognize and then perform some task within Cosmopolis.\n\nThe bots weren't really inspired by anything other than old MUD programs but there was a beautiful line of code,\nthat one of the leads always looked at, line 26 in a sample script of github's hubot.\n\nThe bots were special,\nthey greatly simplified simulations and reasoning about this virtual test city.\n\nAs a whole they already created a very simple,\nbut living simulation.\n\nFor example one internal bot would be responsible for generating weather in Night City,\nthe bot actually got its information from Detroit's own weather service.\n\nAnd our virtual Alice had a setting in her profile,\nthat would alert her when it was raining, she would then equip an umbrella before leaving for work.\n\nBots gave Cosmopolis that early life,\nthat made working on the system fun.\n\nBut by far the most special thing about bots,\nwas that they could be replaced by a real human,\nby a person that would turn off the bot and log in into their account.\n\nIn the next release of the program,\nthe girls focused on enhancing this feature.\n\nA bot could be instructed to ship groceries from Amazon,\nbut when a real person took over for an account,\nthey could go to a local store and buy and deliver the groceries for a small payment.\n\nEven in the early tests, it was becoming more an more obvious,\nthat a powerful automated framework that could help people make money could be built.\n\nAs with every program the girls were worried about its adoption,\nbut it was universally agreed that people would join to make money,\nand in the end large cities would go online within weeks,\nbecause it helped people put food on the table by trading small services.\n\nCosmopolis 2.0 was what got the attention of United Nations,\nbut that is a story for another time.\n\nPersonal Note,\n\nBecoming a programmer is not that hard, and when you have a dream like our story of Cosmopolis here,\nit becomes a fun hobby that you just aimlessly poke at when there is some time in a day.\n\nThere is a tradition of creating Programming Cook-books, they are books tailored for a specific language,\nthat contain short recipes, and it is really fun to flip through it, and see what this programming thing is about.\n\nI recommend learning JavaScript, which is currently called ES2020, to actually execute a program you will need an interpreter.\n\nYour browser has one built in, as JavaScript is the language of the web, look up how to open the web console in your browser of choice.\n\nThe industry standard for server-side JavaScript applications like our Imaginary Cosmopolis is Node.js,\nif interested you can search for video tutorials to help you get started.\n\n\n[express]: https://expressjs.com/\n[MUD]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD\n[line

<div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">you must first invent the universe.</div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"mb-5 section-spacer\">&#xA0;</div>\n    <div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n      <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/WardCunningham\">Ward Cunningham</a> the inventor of WikiWiki,\n        <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">has absolutely solved the problem of starting in the beginning.</div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div

class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n        <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">In short, a unit of disk information in the first Cosmopolis was not a file,</div>\n        <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">it was a directory, with randomly named files prefixed with a version number.</div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n      <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n        <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">For example,

<div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">The brilliant thing about this is that when two people save version 15 at the same time,</div>\n        <div class=\"paragraph card-text

 <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n        <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">So, they had a collaborative editing platform in less than 100 lines of

      "text": "At first they laughed, then they called them a cult,\nthen accused them of corruption, and when it was all over,\nmost called them The Founding Mothers.\n\nWe didn't live under a threat of Nuclear War,\nthe models predicted the war as 100% certain.\n\nThis is what happens, when one generation passes onto the next,\nMutually Assured Destruction.\n\nIt didn't take computer models,\nit didn't require an imagination,\nwar only needs time, guns and borders.\n\nFor uneducated humans, war is a certainty,\nwar is where we all come from.\n\nThe models predicted that it would take decades,\nnearly a century to reach a stable disarmament.\n\nOne of the greatest problems that Humanity faces is born of group cohesion,\nwhen we lived in tribes automatic self-indoctrination ensured tribe stability.\n\nWhen the world connected,\naccepting the cultures and beliefs of the local group we were born into, divided us from the rest creating a border.\n\nThe threat of nuclear war grew, and it was not disarmament,\nbut leaving all the bad ideas behind, that would make all the difference.\n\nAbandoning invisible indoctrination and leaving imperceptibly-bad ideas behind,\ncan only occur on generation by generation level.\n\nThe generations with cultures holding bad ideas needed to retire out of old age,\nand a more realistic, more educated, wiser and humane culture, was to take over.\n\nNo abrupt changes could be made without conflict,\nout of love for all Life and Humanity this was the first project to require over a hundred years of work.\n\nAnd so sweetly, one of the girls said, that this would require the work of a League,\nThe League of Extraordinary Ladies, another one jokingly proclaimed in a grumbly tone.\n\nAnd the Universe,\ndid smile.\n\nThe models revealed that Political Borders and Nationalism in a Nation armed with Nuclear Weapons,\nwould result in a high probability of a Nuclear War, as each generation is indoctrinated into the worst ideas of the previous.\n\nThe most terrifying model prediction was that as more and more got lost in translation between consecutive generations,\nthe probability of nuclear war approached 100%.\n\nAnd as all Heroines do, The League of Extraordinary Ladies,\nset off on a multi-generational promise, to save the world.\n\nThe weakness, of the ease with which we accept the culture we are born into as true and perfect,\nwas going to be addressed by a novel educational program creatively named the Global Progressive Advancement (GPA).\n\nVolunteers would create free, open, unbranded, library of audio books out of works in public domain,\nand the website would stitch these works together into Audio Lectures with the aid of speakers, poets and teachers.\n\nCelebrities, well known authors, and even movie stars would contribute their time, voice and patience,\nto create what became the greatest work of art, that by far exceeded even the most romantic descriptions of the Library of Alexandria.\n\nA number of authors donated their works to the school,\nstudents participating in the free self-paced open-curriculum school had access to Carl Sagan, Bill Bryson, Neil deGrasse Tyson, and pretty much all the others.\n\nBy 2050, it was the only school taken seriously,\nbecause it was the only school that resulted in students showing great results.\n\nThe school brought the world together in Knowledge and Wisdom,\nand as predicted in less than a 150 years from the initial inception, the borders fell.\n\nA new, and more informed, nuclear disarmament program was born,\nthat decades after resulted in cessation of weapons manufacturing of all kind throughout Europe and Asia.\n\nThese seemingly fantastic, impossible goals of world peace,\nwere achieved by helping Humanity converge on wisdom by means of books made more accessible by narrators.\n\nProviding superior education to the children of a nation,\nwhilst letting their parents live out culture they were born into,\nis a form of Infinite Kindness, it is a form of Love.\n\nRather than the children inheriting just the culture of their parents and the nation they were born to,\nby participating in the Global Progressive Advancement program, they also inherited the best ideas and wisdom from Humanity's most beloved books.\n\nWorld Peace was reached by taking advantage of our susceptibility to cultural indoctrination,\nto blindly and without a question accepting ideas of the world we are born into,\nthis was not a trick, but much needed medicine and vaccine that prevented mutually assured destruction.\n\nWe simply added Knowledge and Wisdom,\nto the culture and spirit of times, to all the nations.\n\nThe first and foremost force of the educational program was not knowledge,\nit was Reality, something that corruption and decay is incapable of using for its advantage.\n\nThe reality of the human condition is that we all yearn for wisdom,\nand meaning, and love, and kinship and belonging.\n\nIt mattered not if it was two boys that Father Gregory Boyle was raising,\nor two nations that hated each other in starvation for wisdom.\n\nOnce they had access to wisdom,\nreality helped to unravel their misunderstandings and helped them grow.\n\nThe League of Extraordinary Ladies didn't stop at Nuclear Disarmament,\ntheir granddaughters ended poverty.\n\nThey did so by, now the age old tradition of using weakness to fight weakness,\nthey ended poverty by means of poverty.\n\nIt was a micro management, and micro payment transaction platform,\ndistributed on smart tablets that helped communities of the world trade services.\n\nThe adoption of the platform was hastened by the fact that no money was made from these transactions by the hosting company,\nif someone needed a car ride, or grocery delivery, housework, or a tutor to help their kids with math, there was always someone ten minutes away that would help.\n\nOne of the untended features of this program was local pantry,\na feature originally intended for trading foodstuffs, that later became a place to feed the hungry.\n\nThe trading platform also helped to place the homeless in unused hotels and apartments,\nin such a way that they had easy access to care takers, teachers, therapists and a chance at a better future.\n\nIt is hard to say what prevented Humanity as a whole from coming together like these friends did,\nbut it is easy to see that it was internet that helped communities collaborate and communicate better.\n\nWe needed programs to help us talk to each other,\nand cut out the middle men.\n\nWe needed programs that helped cities become more independent,\nand stop relying on the state and nation that by contrast meant little.\n\nAnd we needed to begin thinking in decades,\nin centuries.\n\nBecause our problems, do not end with us,\nand what we leave behind is easily misunderstood.\n\nWhat was originally created as a deterrent, come future, in chaos, in poverty, in haste,\ngiven all that is lost in translation, will eventually become the tool that it really is.\n\n\n[Father Gregory Boyle]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipR0kWt1Fkc",

Today, the only reason why the old ways are still in place,\nis because low quality schools are continuing to try to stay in business - this is evil.\n\nToday, with the help of computers, smart phones and tablets,\ninteractive/open curricula, online lectures, Audio Books, and internet,\nit is possible to approach each student individually,\nI am sure there are online schools that are trying to do just that.\n\nThere is no excuse for why anybody should have less than an A, or a 4.0 GPA,\nthat is what being in school is about, learning, and when you have learned, you get an A.\n\nEven now, I can't see everything that has gone wrong,\nschools have become a bit less unforgiving, I am sure.\n\nBut even so, the fact remains,\ntoday schools can't teach.\n\nThey are wicked good,\nat tricking students into thinking that they are not smart enough for good grades.\n\nAt the end of the day,\nyou will still need an education.\n\nYour only safe bet,\nis becoming self taught,\nindependent study.\n\nAnd please, don't let anybody call you a Genius,\nhelp others, help them find knowledge too.\n\nFinally,\nI describe this tragedy to the best of my abilities,\non a tired mind, some things have slipped, others are out of shape, please forgive me.\n\nBut, I do know one thing for certain,\nthis is not a standing tragedy that will remain forever.\n\nThis is a call for heroism,\nfor courage, and courage calls to courage everywhere.\n\nThis is how Life asks for help,\nyou are now being challenged to stand up to mediocrity, to lies.\n\nBecome a Great Being,\nFix Schools.\n\nPersonal note,\n\nHere is a short list of my favorite science popularizes.\n\nBill Bryson\nRichard Dawkins\nSam Harris\nPZ Myers\nLawrence Krauss\nLord Martin Rees\nJill Tarter\nSeth Shostak\nAlex Filippenko\nSean Carroll\nJared Diamond\nHoward Zinn\n\n\n[Panama Papers]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Papers\n[you will still need an education]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGoZZvfEd6A",

Bryson, Tyson, and Hitch.\n\nThere would be no war,\nwe've already had enough of war.\n\nEducation stopped filling us with Knowledge,\nschools are pretending to teach now.\n\nPerhaps it has always been the case,\nbut today, they aren't even trying.\n\nWhat student's learn they learn on their own,\nschools just provide the tests and entertainment.\n\nWe are more than this,\neven though the Doctor may get their M.D.,\nthere may not be a world to practice in.\n\nThe threat of nuclear war has grown,\nin the past 50 years the world lost two-thirds of its wildlife.\n\nJust because some percentage of students are learning,\nit does not mean that schools are working.\n\nIt takes more than a Doctor of a Lawyer,\nit takes precisely 7,800,000,000 of well educated and reasonably informed people.\n\nAll it takes to get there is free access to audio versions of leading books,\nwhere students can learn in privacy, in peace, and without the threat of shame.\n\nSchool is fake,\nit is not working.\n\nFake Education is tearing us apart,\npushing the world further into an unsustainable fantasy.\n\nLet us help each other,\nplease, search the Public Domain for books that move you,\nteach your self to narrate them, and share this beautiful art,\nout of love, and for peace, and freedom, and for all the future generations to come.\n\nLet us bring levels of knowledge up to where they should be,\nwe are better than this, we are smarter than this, we are greater than this.\n\nSchool and education are cold and heartless words.\n\nIt is, love of life, and love of wisdom, and love of knowing,\nand love of finding things out, and love of The Universe we live in.\n\nLet us stop pretending that education is enough,\nKnowledge, we must learn to stand in relentless pursuit of Knowledge,\nour Greatest Adventure, at our own pace, and in our own sequence.\n\nEducation can make a Doctor,\nbut it is Knowledge and Wisdom that makes a Great Being.\n\nLet us help the little ones to Knowledge and Wisdom,\nso that their children are born to a Kinder, and More Compassionate, and Peaceful World.\n\nA world most worthy of them.\n\nLet us begin by reading, narrating or listening to World's most beloved non-fiction and adventure books.\n\nFor in the absence of real education,\nwe become the teachers.",

bullies,\nmake sure they all come back from home.\n\nTheir violence is an expression of abuse,\nthere is nothing you can do.\n\nYou are being asked to stare into the Teachers Soul,\nespecially when the bullies come, and she turns her head.\n\nAnd you are being asked to be the first one to call the police,\nif someone is in danger, get everything on video, upload.\n\nWatch the Security Guards,\nmake sure that everyone is keeping a distance from all the students.\n\nSo, by now the teachers have you half way,\ntowards believing that you are dumb, a loser, and a waste of time.\n\nThey have been using you to tidy up their Grade Statistics,\ntheir statistics can't stick out, they need a usual distribution of grades.\n\nIf it was all As, someone would come around asking why,\nyou are the \"F\" that makes their bullshit look legitimate.\n\nI know, you know, that your grades your bad, because you were not learning before,\nand now you don't have the base, that would help you understand what the teacher is saying right now.\n\nBut you are wrong.\n\nNobody else learned that stuff either,\neven some of the kids that had tutors, didn't learn it, they just memorized it.\n\nYou'd have to be a freak of nature,\nto actually comprehend that curriculum, please, please, don't memorize garbage.\n\nBe careful, the teachers, and principals maybe suffering a kind of collective delusion:\n\n\"...The principal and I rejected his alibi and hung a fat zero on his final exam.\nThat dropped his precalculus grade down from a B+ to a D+.\nIt lingered like a purple bruise on his college applications.\"\nBen Orlin \"When Memorization Gets in the Way of Learning\" The Atlantic, September 9, 2013.\n\nYou are just as smart as everybody else,\nyou are just as smart as Newton was before he started reading books he liked.\n\nThere are no gifted individuals,\nbut there are individuals who like being celebrated as gifted, of special, or above all else.\n\nThey want it so bad,\nthat they go home and memorize that garbage, garbage.\n\nEven though your mind is perfectly fine,\nyou still need Knowledge, you need an integrated picture of the world.\n\nA clear picture constructed out of a hundred books,\nloved an admired by Intellectuals, Scientists, Philosophers, those who show great achievement.\n\nBy sitting in the back row, and constantly being made to feel stupid,\nthey are stressing you out and preventing you from enjoying life up to a point where you can listen to Audio Books and Lectures.\n\nThis place is standing between you and knowledge,\nand calling you stupid while its at it.\n\nThis is why you can't drop out,\nbecause if this continues the world will fall apart.\n\nYour real study,\nbegins right now.\n\nYou have to figure out,\nhow this place works.\n\nWho the teachers answer to,\nwho the principals answer to.\n\nHow are they getting paid,\nfor this s*it.\n\nYou have to understand the school system,\nbecause you are going to fix it.\n\nThere is a couple of teachers,\nand a handful of students that will help you.\n\nLearn from the internet how to give speeches,\nand begin preparing yourself for speaking out against fake education.\n\nForgive the memorizes, they are often under as much pressure as the bullies are,\nthey are just better at keeping their mind from fracturing.\n\nSome of them maybe admiring you,\nthat you are so strong that you don't pretend to learn.\n\nIf one of the girls tries to talk to you,\ndon't freak out just say the truth:\n\n\"I am shy, I need some time to be able to speak with you,\nif you help me, I'll be your friend.\"\n\nand then add,\n\n\"I am going to try to fix school, I'll need a lot of help.\"\n\nAnd everything will work out.\n\nMy Friend,\n\nA school that pretends to teach,\nis a school that robs you of knowledge.\n\nCivilizations do not die with a bang,\nit happens so slowly that nobody notices when all the trees are gone.\n\nHow many Tigers are left in your time?\nI hope you still have a few, I had 4,000 when I wrote this.\n\nThe Nuclear superpowers,\nchose Mutually Assured Destruction, over Disarmament.\n\nAnd prisons were full of people who were warped,\nby stress, poverty, and lack of Knowledge,\nit was Ten Million at the time of writing.\n\nThe blindness starts in school,\nwhen Knowledge is replaced with disconnected facts and memorization.\n\nAnd it continues,\ngrow strong my friend,\nspeak Wisely, Nobly and Loudly.\n\nImagine what it will be like when it is all over, and schools begin working.\n\nEvery formula animated before student's eyes, paid internships all around the word,\nstudent exchange will be the first and foremost, adventures in England, Germany, Australia, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein, and why not.\n\nStudent Stipend will grant the students years of Enlightenment and Adventure,\nthe only grade will be their own path of education from Middle-school to University,\nall their curiosities combined together into a Hard Cover book,\nthat others may follow and improve upon in a Fellowship of Enlightenment.\n\nBegin your journey with A Short History of Nearly Everything, by Bill Bryson,\nleap to A People's History of the United States by Howard Zinn,\nfor light reading try What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions by Randall Munroe,\nsee if you can find a copy of The Giants of Philosophy Series read by Charlton Heston,\nand look into The Teaching Company Lectures.\n\nTo make money, find a Start-up Accelerator similar to YCombinator near you,\nand begin building Virtual Schools Online, borrow from Massively multiplayer online games.\n\nPlease don't be alone, but even if you do end up trying to save the world alone,\nyou will be in company of great beings, my Friend, and the future generations will stand upon your shoulders.\n\nHere are some Starting Points, Thinkers and Scientists to get you started.\n\nBen Orlin \"When

Its positive impact on the Voter, and City, State, and Nation Governments,\nand above all the well being of our Planet.)\n\nBook Two: Governing The World,\nis a book about establishing a Computer Program Managed Democracy,\nit is very much an augmented reality, a mirror of our world where our voices count for more.\n\nThe program harnesses the Wisdom of the Educated Humanity;\nfor City, State, Nation, and Earth management.\n\nIt is worth noting that it is to have its beginnings as a Interactive Fiction game,\nthat is collaboratively expanded, much like the world encyclopedia.\n\nBook Three: Human Rights,\nis a volume detailing stories about growing up in the world,\nit is just essays that highlight what people can do to help the World Grow,\nand how to go about it to become triumphant.\n\nThis book speaks about a path to a United Humanity,\nit is not just about putting an end to the idea of borders as the European Union so nobly demonstrates,\nbut it is about getting ready to commit all ideas that result in dividing us to history books,\nand accepting the fact that we are just one family, that we are the Wise Caretakers of Earth and all of Her Inhabitants.\n\nHuman Rights must also highlight the problem of inequality that leads to Incarceration,\npeople are going to prisons due to lack of Education and Knowledge.\nDue to Stress, Poverty. Mental Disorders and Illness some of which is rooted in Neurological Disorders born from poverty, addiction, and unsafe environments.\n\nPrisons must be replaced with Schools,\nHuman beings do not belong in cages.\n\nFurthermore,\nThe first and foremost purpose of a Government is to end poverty, homelessness, hunger, and sickness to the best of our abilities.\nThis means a Universal Basic Income, real money indistinguishable from a paycheck earned by hard work.\n\nPeople who face Poverty, Hunger, Homelessness, treatable Illness,\nwho feel isolated or excluded, will be unable to study and comprehend these great Works of Love that this text describes.\nWe are One Family, we need their help, we need all of Humanity to permanently come together and leave bad ideas behind.\n\nBook Four: The Human Manual,\nIs a Book of world's most inspirational and beloved essays.\n\nIt contains the following;\ncheerful chapters for Mighty Five Year Olds,\ninspiring essays for the Unstoppable Ten Year Olds,\na loving introduction to the complexity of the world for Fifteen Year olds,\nand powerful and moving lessons for Teenagers and Twenty-somethings, lessons that many Thirty and Forty Year olds will lovingly return to.\n\nThese works are not meant to be set in stone,\nthe doors to new essays, submissions, and repairs, will always be open.\n\nThey are to be translated into all the languages spoken today,\nin order to encourage global communication and unity.\n\nThese works, are works of the Universal Human Love,\nof Human Beings finally coming together to form a Single United Family.\n\nAs a United Humanity,\nwe can easily face all the challenges ahead.",

Vastness of Heart.\n\nThere is no describing it, but these Beautiful Beings,\nsmile, and laugh, no matter the weather,\n\nAnd when they speak, they seem to be part of Cosmos,\nnot just Earth.\n\nA Mechanic who borrows from his work,\nfor purposes of Wisdom.\n\nWill hold up a screw,\nand say.\n\n\"In order for this important piece of the system to do its job,\nyou have to know when too much of tightening the screw will damage it.\"\n\nThis is a good example of what we see in schools,\nElementary is a Dream, Middle School kind of works,\nbut creating High School by just making subjects more demanding, is insane.\n\nThe screw is tightened,\ndamaged, and now, it cannot be repaired.\n\nAt the very least, we must help the children to create a start-up,\nto work together on building 3D printed inventions, learning Linux, and coming up with new stuff.\n\nAnd help them setup a way of charging customers,\na way of advertising products, and wipe their fears of poverty.\n\nThe kids, are always smarter than us,\nthey build on top of what we have built.\n\nWe are not giving them the tools for their future,\nwe teach pure Trigonometry and this cannot be dumber.\n\nBecause to teach Trigonometry,\nall the teacher has to do is create a class about\nbuilding games that get published on Steam (game store).\n\nWhat a teacher may not do,\nis force feed pure triangle garbage to people who don't have an interest in it.\n\nIt is not hormones (and no teacher should ever say that), students simply stop listing,\nwhen they figure out the teachers are... selling them out for a paycheck.\n\nDreamers are my favorite,\nhere is someone who sits down and thinks up the following,\n\n\"If I was born on a different continent,\nto a different religion, I would be asked to worship that other god that I am told is false.\"\n\n\"Furthermore,\" - and you know there is always a furthermore,\nthat's part of the reason why they cannot be stopped.\n\n\"Aren't we all atheists,\nto all the other gods.\"\n\nAnd just when you think she was done with it,\nshe adds \"Why don't we go the extra step and love All Life, All Wisdom, All Good Ideas, and All Human Beings\"\n\nAnd the next thing you know,\nyou realize she was never a Dreamer, nor was she ever little.\n\nShe's a Philosopher.\n\nTo tell children, that there exists a group of Universal Beings,\nthat dedicate their lives and immortality to Wisdom,\nand passing it on to all the future generations,\nis to help them grow from the highest of mountains.\n\nAnd the Urban Explorer,\nthey see homes after the families left.\n\nThey see pictures,\nand smiles, and forgotten hopes.\n\nThey see passage of time,\nthey see the motion of generation upon generation.\n\nThey can see the homes as they were on Christmas,\nand they can read the medical bills scattered in the corner.\n\nThese so called scoundrels,\noften chased away like dogs.\n\nThey are working on wording a lesson,\nthat they hope to voice some day.\n\nMaybe come their golden age,\nas Guggenheim shows their works.\n\nThey will speak of leaving bad ideas behind,\nand sharing in all the good ones.\n\nHow truly precious all our daily chores,\nhow it is these little ordinary moments that add to create almost all our lives.\n\n\"There are no ordinary moments\" as Dan Millman says.\n\nLayer by layer, and the sequence will come deep from within the heart,\nand it will reveal it self by means of curiosity.\n\nWhen a day comes, and you find yourself looking out the window,\nwith more pleasure than than writing games or interactive fiction,\nor managing your corporation, or putting out fire tornadoes.\n\nDeep from within your heart,\na new curiosity calls to you.\n\nAnd it can only make you better,\nbetter at what you do, help you climb higher than the height you are on right now.\n\nYou don't have to switch careers,\nbut you do need to throw a loaf of bread into your back pack.\n\nAnd hit the trail.\n\nIf you are out east Section Hike the Appalachian Trail,\nif you are out west than hike the Pacific Crest Trail,\nif you are out in the Pacific then set of for the Kalalau on the island of Ka'uai.\n\nBring your Audio Books,\nand make no mistake,\n\nBecause the end of that trail,\nmarks only the beginning of your new adventure.\n\nRemember the aim, my friends:\nVastness Of Heart!",

to us.\n\nNever force yourself to learn something you don't enjoy,\njust keep reading books, and keep looking for something to strike your fancy.\n\nFrom Dreaming, and Inventing,\nto Art, Programming and taking to the skies.\n\nAn invention can be as simple,\nas an LED Throwie or LED Glowie.\n\nJust a Light Emitting Diode, a battery and magnet,\nto keep it all together; and as a bonus make it stick to metal surfaces.\n\nThat is a three component invention,\nLED, magnet, battery.\n\nMy favorite Radio Astronomer,\nSeth Shostak.\n\nQuips, that the baseline for determining if a member of a species is intelligent,\nis whether or not it can hold a soldering iron, and make a radio.\n\nAllow me to get you soldering a radio,\nas quickly as possible.\n\nGet a Raspberry PI Zero W (the W stands for Wireless or \"with WI-FI\"),\na soldering kit, a solder wick, some GPIO headers,\nand a 4 x 8 RGB LED HAT that fits a Raspberry PI Zero neatly.\n\nLook everything up on YouTube,\nhow to solder, how to solder headers, how to use a solder wick.\n\nThis is serious business,\nin last few years embedded Linux became extremely inexpensive.\n\nThough get a $30 kit\nthat includes a case, power adapter, heat sinks, and a header.\n\nAt first you connect it to a keyboard and a monitor,\nand set it up on the network.\n\nBut later as you figure everything out,\nyou unplug everything leaving just the power.\n\nTo get inside it,\nyou use a remote terminal.\n\nOnce you login,\nyou get a command prompt.\n\nIt listens to words, to commands,\nvery similar to adventure games.\n\nIndeed, directories on your hard-drive,\nare very much like rooms in a game.\n\nTo get inside Documents,\ntype in \"cd Documents\"\n\nThe command \"cd\" is short for,\nChange Directory, a Directory is the same as a folder on windows.\n\nWhen you say \"cd Documents\",\nyou are giving the cd command an argument, or an option, or a setting, or a preference.\n\nThe cd command is a perfect example of how command line interfaces should work,\njust a couple of words and nothing more.\n\nBut sometimes, that is not enough,\nlike for example when you want to ask \"cd\" for help.\n\nWe can't say \"cd help\" becasue then the cd command would search for a directory named help,\nwe have to make the second word special, to do that you use hyphens.\n\nYou can type in \"cd --help\",\nit will notice the hyphens, and print out some helpful information.\n\nTo see what is in a directory, type in \"ls\",\nwhich is short for list, or list files.\n\n\"ls\" also accepts special inputs,\nyou can ask it for help like above.\n\nBut also ask it to list files in a long format,\nby saying \"ls -l\" here we use a singe hyphen, because \"-l\" is commonly used,\nthe -l is short for \"--long-listing\", but nobody bothers spelling that out.\n\nTo list files with readable file sizes,\nyou have to add -h, here -h has long form, and some people may use spell it out as \"--human-readable\"\n\nUsually when writing complex commands that other people will use,\nthe long form is preferred, bu when you are just typing on the command line and want to do something quickly,\nyou just use the short versions.\n\nThe command line interface is trying to be your friend,\nit wants to function with just one or two words, but it also some with extras like the --human-readable flag.\n\nThere are many tutorials on how to use the command line,\nand many books, my favorite are the pocket books, take a look at O'Reilly Bash Pocket Reference\n\nHere are instructions on how to play audio through HDMI,\nyour monitor should have an audio out somewhere.\n\nNow see if you can get that GPIO header soldered on,\nand try to blink some of the RGB LED HAT lights based on this tutorial.\n\nAlternatively you can just blink a simple LED based on this instructable,\nnote that a standard Raspberry PI 4 8GB comes with the header soldered on to make things easier.\n\nAnd there is also a Raspberry PI WH,\nmeaning Wireless with Headers pre-soldered.\n\nAnd now, get a $10 camera,\nand use raspistill to take a photo,\nand play around with all the other options.\n\nNow you have an inexpensive platform for your inventions,\na programmable machine, that you access over the radio of your wireless network.\n\nYou can make it blink, or take time-lapse photographs of the next snow storm,\nyou can get an LCD screen and turn it into a tablet.\n\nRaspberry PI is not the only Single-board computer,\nPINE looks really nice as well.\n\nIf you are looking for a more complicated project,\nperhaps try building a Raspberry PI Drone,\nbonus if you can get it to cross the Atlantic.\n\nWe have no limits,\nbut we are also very unique.\n\nOur inventions need not rely on commuters,\nsome of the greatest inventions the Human Kind has seen, were just ideas.\n\nDon't let anybody stop you from inventing,\nand don't stop dreaming.\n\nFinally, the most impractical and outrageous inventions,\nmake for the most magnificent Videos, White Papers, CVs, and Resumes.\n\nAim,\nfor the Moon.\n\n\n[Seth Shostak]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_udY35m3SdE\n[4 x 8 RGB LED HAT]:

there are very few real criminals, most were just warped by lack of school.\n\nReal schools, have the ability,\nto prevent a person from committing a crime.\n\nOn top of that, upon committing a crime,\nif prisons were turned to special need schools, we could help almost everyone.\n\nReal schools are not that complex,\nplus they can use poverty to their advantage.\n\nBy presenting students with a way out of poverty that fits them,\nthe students will be put in a position where they will want to learn particular things.\n\nThat's how real education works,\nit is not about tests an memorization, but need, imagination, triumph and challenge.\n\nBe it a misguided voter, a desperate student, or someone blinded by fear and anger and poverty,\nschools are all there really is, it is the greatest hope and dream.\n\nWhat we call a school today, is not a school,\nit is a collective fantasy that hands the teachers a paycheck, and the students a diploma.\n\nOur cognitive biases make it so that we go along with it,\nthere are people out there who hold up a diploma they crammed for and truly believe they are an engineer.\n\nThis is probably similar to when a person commits a crime,\nthey say \"This is is this is where I finally become free\", but that is only cartoon reality.\n\nA college diploma does not mean that the student is educated,\nand when deans are pressed they will say, \"We discouraged cramming\".\n\nAnd when everyone is pressed to own up,\nthe mother of the boy who stole,\nthe engineer's professor,\nand the engineer and the student,\nand that so called criminal,\n\nthe men who approve textbooks,\nthose who pray to fairy-tales in hopes of saving nations they mistakenly destroyed,\n\nand the prime ministers, and royalty,\npopes and cardinals,\nand the congresses, and the president,\n\nand the men who nearly destroyed this nation by the practice of \"enhanced interrogation\",\nand those who ignored climate change and might have done a lot worse than torture,\n\nand those who are glad, that we all forgot,\nthat we have all pointed intercontinental ballistic missiles at each other,\nall the major cities, all of them, every family, every future.\n\nAll they will say is this:\n\n\"I was JUST following orders.\"\n\n\"I JUST didn't know.\"\n\n\"HOW was I supposed to know?\"\n\nThis is what fake education results in,\nthis is the \"fake it until you make it\" pattern of behavior.\n\nThe solution to it all is books,\nbooks that those of us who are good at narration,\nread for others who aren't very good at reading.\n\nTeams of students, ganging up together to record books, with laughter, and foolishness,\nand dammit, sometimes adding whole new chunks to them, to make the dry parts more interesting.\n\nAnd sharing, with everyone,\neverywhere.\n\nLaughter is the ultimate seal of authenticity,\nthat something is worth our time.\n\nOnce the world awakens to the realization that students should make the lectures,\ndriving them with collective curiosities and inspirations, and sharing them for free.\n\nKids will want to watch them,\nthey will want to see what happens next.\n\nCan you imagine a set of lectures by students working to bring back Pixel Art Games,\nlectures on the subject of Color Theory, Trigonometry, Calculus, Music Composition, and even woodworking for the arcade cabinets.\n\nCan you see what having that full vision do to a young mind,\nhow inspiring it is to see the classroom succeed in turning out, one game after another, and making a pretty penny too.\n\nReal schools combine with reality,\nthey are both an introduction to the real world and a future extension of it.\n\nI know that all of this is a lot to take in,\nit is a description of the biggest of our problems,\nand the middle of our solutions.\n\nThe beginning is much simpler than that,\nthe beginning starts off like every superhero origin story ever told.\n\nYou build up your power,\nyou armor.\n\nYou pick up your first book, your second book, your third book,\nMetamorphosis, Walden, Cosmos, Into The Wild.\n\nSagan, Bryson, Thoreau, Kafaka, Krakauer, Kant, Nietzche,\nDawkins, Harris, Hitchens, Dennett, and countelss others.\n\nWith each book you hear, you inherit you inherit the wisdom of the author,\njust like that, straight up data transfer,\nand re-listening to the same audio books or lectures makes them even more powerful.\n\nIt takes a few years to take it all on,\nbut before you know it, your own idea synthesis kicks in.\n\nYou'll be able to feel the world,\nand feel the fear of the fakers, and pretenders.\n\nYou'll be able to see the paths of change,\nthat the world needs so that it may continue growing.\n\nYou'll be able to connect, restore, repair, and resume,\nthe thoughts of all great beings from across all the ages.\n\nYour intelligence is not set in stone, it is flexible,\nyour mind is there to help you become more and more intelligent.\n\nThe more you know, the faster you learn more,\nand the wiser and more intelligent you become.",

sounds lonely to me.\n\nEvery time you come back from a little adventure,\nand see that \"JACK PINE CAMPGROUND HIKE-IN SITES\" sign, it will feel like coming back home.\n\nJack Pine is a wonderful place,\naim to stay there a month if you can.\n\nMove from site to site,\nstay a day at the State Park, shower and come back to Jack Pine until you had enough.\n\nFinally, when it is time to leave Jack Pine,\ngrab a pine cone to remember it by, and head to Nordhouse, just for a day or two.\n\nThey have a metal box you slip a few dollars into to get a parking permit,\nand you'll have to hike a bit to get to the Wideness area, but it will be worth it.\n\nIt is so beautiful, that you may wish to stay longer than a couple of days,\nyou can walk the woods via Arrowhead Trail, or take the beach.\n\nWatch for breaks in the grass,\nthat usually means there is a neat campsite out there.\n\nJack Pine will always feel very welcoming,\nNordhouse is a bit wilder.\n\nYou will have sand in your gear, and car for months,\nhopefully to last you a whole winter so that you may get a refill come spring.\n\nI say the Nordhouse sand brings good luck, and good memories,\nwhen you are stressed out in a hurry, and notice there is still some sand left...\n\nIt will put things in perspective,\ntake you back to your latest camping adventure for a moment, help you slow down.\n\nAnd above all, remind you to tidy up your gear,\ngive that old tent a sniff and see if you need to order a new one.\n\nBefore you know it,\nit will be ample time to head on out there again.\n\nOne of the healthiest things we can do,\nis sync up with the sun... go to sleep at sundown and get up at sunrise.\n\nAnother is to always make sure,\nwe have plenty of room in our life to read or listen to books.\n\nAnd most importantly, Nature,\nthe bird song,\nthe chipmunk squeaks,\nthe crisp air,\nthe rich woodland fragrance of moss, fern and bear,\nthe building of a fire,\nswimming in the lake,\nexploring ancient dunes,\naimlessly collecting fossils and cute pebbles by the beach,\nwatching a beautiful storm in the distance,\nsearching for arrowheads...\n\n...suddenly popping into the nearby gas-station to get more ice cream and sausage,\nand then getting back to the camp, for another long and starry evening,\nand slowly falling asleep, just to wake up to a another healing day.\n\nNever forget your dreams,\nnever forget who you are.\n\nNever, overwork yourself,\njust because you can it does not mean you should.\n\nWe are far too beautiful to treat ourselves cogs in a machine,\nwe are meant to grow, and bloom, and inspire, and move entire generations.\n\nWe are so good at learning, and understanding, and mastering knowledge,\nthat past a few books, the undiscovered country beacons.\n\nWe are a young civilization,\ndo not let that push you around.\n\nYou are to discover your path to becoming a Great Being,\nand help the world grow in Wisdom and in Peace.\n\n\n[The Four Horsemen Discussion]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DKhc1pcDFM\n[my office is there]: https://goo.gl/maps/EkQ991wM6qqLk7et8\n[Nordhouse]: https://goo.gl/maps/wwegDL9VawQ1GFn5A",

      "text": "The first point of failure,\nand our first hope for repairs.\n\nIs focus on real education.\n\nSchools are graduating students that they failed to educate,\nthese children grow into confused adults, lost and looking for belonging.\n\nWhy is this tolerated?\n\nLet me ask you,\nwhat would happen if we asked all the College Graduates to re-take all their tests from high school on?\n\nShouldn't people who graduated college easily show improvement to their GPA when re-taking all their tests?\n\nShouldn't those who graduated, but can't pass their test,\nask for a refund, or a lawsuit for having been tricked into an impression of education?\n\nIt is tolerance of these simple stupid problems,\nthat leads to made up lives of fantasy and eventual blindness towards evil.\n\nIf you can't pass all the college tests and get a higher GPA than that with which you graduated college,\nthen you do not have a college education.\n\nIf you can't pass all the high school tests and get a higher GPA than that with which you graduated high school with,\nthen you do not have a high school education.\n\nIf you can't pass all the middle school tests and get a higher GPA than the one you left middle school with,\nthen you do not have a middle school education.\n\nNot only that, but the way these schools teach and the knowledge they drive into you,\nmay not be useful; you may not even have a useful education.\n\nI think we can all agree here,\nthat we have a problem.\n\nAt the very least,\nif your child has bad grades, don't make them feel bad, or unintelligent.\n\nYou should move them to a different type of school,\nwhere teachers are interested in educated children rather than turning them into a paycheck.\n\nThe reason why it does not occur to parents that schools are not working,\nis that they don't have experience with fake institutions, they take them for granted.\n\nThey are indoctrinated into a culture where school is good,\nand being a worker is great, and it takes a particularly awful person not to achieve anything in life.\n\nSo what are those achievements?\n\nHow is all that retesting going?\n\nThe problem, as you can imagine, is much larger,\ntolerance of fake education is just the beginning.\n\nAbove all,\nHumanity must grow.\n\nWe are not allowed to tolerate Human Right Violations,\nall human beings are created equal.\n\nAll must be granted equal opportunity to real education,\nin a world that sets them free from poverty, and helps their bodies stay healthy.\n\nNations are not allowed to oppress their people,\nno one has that right.\n\nNations have a great responsibility to help them to a Real Education,\nin ways that will ignite a life long adventure across all sciences.\n\nAn opinion cannot stand against a fact,\nthat is a sign of illness, a small disorder born from fake-education.\n\nAnd our dignity is such, that we must help each other rise,\nwe are not to tolerate anything that tricks people into believing in options over facts.\n\nFake education has been behind every evil perpetrated on this planet,\nit is very much like a virus, it does two things really well, it spreads, and it reinfects.\n\nWhatever beliefs are too hard to let go of,\nwe only need to place them in history or fantasy books.\n\nIt is wonderful to ponder Ice Giants and Greats Serpents,\nbut only as a fairy tale, or part of our growing up, not as a fact of life.\n\nFake education, unravels us,\nit erases great strides made by great beings, and pulls the younger generations into dark ages.\n\nThe fantasies that bring us calm,\nunravel the minds of the younger generations.\n\nThe reason we search for mere calm,\nis that we ourselves, have been tricked out of real education.\n\nAll these confusing questions,\nare easily treated with made up fantasies.\n\nBut that also serves to defeat the purpose,\nof having a Beautiful and Powerful Mind.\n\nIt makes us weak.\n\nNot a single Human Being is allowed tolerate\nConcentration Camps, Abuse, Child Abuse, Racism and Xenophobia, or Inequality, Hate, or Fake Education.\n\nThose of us who chose to relegate ourselves to a life of fantasy,\nmust also leave the table of public discourse.\n\nThose of us who trade with nations that employ torture,\nare not allowed to hold political positions, they simply can't, it is immoral to tolerate this.\n\nAnybody who is delays Humanity's Progress,\ncontributes to Human Suffering, to all Suffering, Blindness, Misery, War, and Torture.\n\nOur minds are extremely powerful,\nand as they are allowed to develop, we will find unity.\n\nWe will agree on everything,\nas we stabilize amongst each other in wisdom.\n\nGovernment wise, there are no great disagreements,\nthere is only steady progress, forward.\n\nOn the individual level,\nit is not that different.\n\nStress and anger, and sadness yield to Love and Wisdom,\neven tragedy turns around a little bit.\n\nWith real education, we don't fall to pieces because something beautiful ended,\nbut we celebrate that it existed in the first place.\n\nIn wisdom, we seek a different class of things,\nNobler Things that come about as a result of our sense of dignity and real education.\n\nNo longer does anyone go home to a TV dinner,\nsuffering from depression, and fear, and loneliness.\n\nWhat creates an educated government, a real government,\nis prevention of sickness and poverty.\n\nNobody goes home convinced they are a worker,\nor terrified of Human Resources, or or an uneducated \"Boss\".\n\nThere isn't anybody who will argue against free medical care,\nor universal income, or national debt, let it pile up.\n\nThe greater the debt that nations of earth owe to the universe,\nthe higher our level of compassion, empathy and development.\n\nMoney is just a job tracking tool,\non the government level it exists as an abstract idea.\n\nYou don't have to worry about Government Debt,\nit is a good kind of debt, and it has no collectors.\n\nDo you see?\n\nFake Education,\nis tearing this world apart.\n\nFake Education,\nis halting its progress.\n\nIt is neutering our minds,\nit is turning us into workers.\n\nIt makes us ask stupid questions,\nand parade stupid ideals and fake political labels.\n\nWe can't have a world without real education,\nthe dark ages will swallow us through the various tax exempt churches and imaginary gods.\n\nIrrelevant worthless opinions will have us fighting for nothing,\nbecause they are all equally wrong, stupid, and useless.\n\nMy friends,\npay attention to fake education, and everything will work out in the end.\n\nWe will find out way to wisdom,\nwe will converge on World Peace in our Wisest and Noblest ideas.\n\nAll you have to do, is make it clear to everyone around you,\nthat you will not tolerate fake education, that you are not on that side of history.\n\nWrite, Rhyme, Paint, Tag,\nfind your way out of fake education and whatever else is pulling you away from wisdom.\n\nHold up you path, and show them the results,\nso that others may choose follow.\n\nReal Education is marked by wisdom,\nand it shows real results and contributions.\n\nAnd though your hard earned achievements may already be great today,\nyour work is not finished until it brings permanent or lasting contributions towards our eventual convergence on Peace and Wisdom,\n\nEvery Human Being on Earth matters,\nthey are our family.\n\nIf you accept this great endeavor, many who fell prey to fake education may hate you in their own sickness,\nbut their children and the children of their children will grow up in a world transformed, in no small part by you.\n\nWe are one people, we are all meant to be Truly Educated in Our Beautiful Minds,\nand we are all meant to live in safety and in peace looking after one another.\n\nWe are one people.",

      "text": "Wisdom has many names and can be viewed in many different ways,\nmost popular perspective is that [non-academic] Philosophy leads to wisdom.\n\nOne particularly beautiful view,\nhints on wisdom with the words Content of Character.\n\nThe most mechanically sound description is,\nunderstanding new things by subtle analogy to what we already know.\n\nThe most concerning view states that,\nwithout wisdom we will be making mistakes.\n\nI think most reasonable view; is all of the above,\nplus knowledge gained from Adventure, Philosophy, and Science Books and Audio Books.\n\nWhat is it for?\nWhy, it is our Operating System.\n\nPART II, Thought Experiment\n\nAllow me to share with you a thought experiment,\na way of seeing things that aid in your view of the world.\n\nWithout wisdom, we form tribes and elect leaders, shamans, or popes,\nand hire muscle, creatures of violence.\n\nBecause that is the same thing the other tribe is doing,\nand the weaker one will be destroyed with great horror.\n\nThese tribal bare bone behavior did not end in middle ages,\nas one would hope.\n\nThis behavior is the default human behavior for the frightened and uneducated,\nthe desperate, the angry, even the sick.\n\nWe may not understand why criminals do the things they do,\nbut we can imagine one of our family members, who one by one loses everything.\n\nAnd on the last day, when all he has left,\nis an ounce of sanity, and a beating hart, he will fight, steal, and hate just to live another day.\n\nAnd for those who can't imagine why one would like to live another day when it is all pain,\nto persevere memories, to keep the fallen alive.\n\nAnd here we meet a Man of Honor,\na Judge, along with a jury, and wealthy lawyers in fantastic shoes.\n\nAnd all they see is a mad man,\na criminal, a man who needs to be put in a cage.\n\nThe Judge is wrong,\nwhen it comes to putting people in cages, all judges are wrong.\n\nTo restore this man, he needs a home, and books, and friends,\nand an education, and hope, and reams, and free money, and free food.\n\nHe needs to be treated with love and dignity,\nand granted an opportunity to persevere his memories in a book.\n\nThere are no criminals,\nthey are just broken children.\n\nThe ugliness of the worst of them is just an act,\nthey just want to be left alone.\n\nAnd I suppose that evil men do exist,\nbut I don't think there is enough of them in the world to fill a single prison.\n\nThe 10,000,000 people we keep in cages,\nare just children with severe developmental issues.\n\nThere are no political systems advanced enough to treat these beings,\ntheir only hope is the Public Defender.\n\nThe Public Defenders will fight to keep the broken people out of prison,\nbecause they know prison will only make them worse.\n\nIf you ever wanted to see a real Angel,\nask a Judge to let you sit in on a court case, look that tired being in the eyes.\n\nWe are Human Beings,\nwe are not animals to be kept in cages.\n\nI have met snarling beasts,\nand I saw their red faces and bulging eyes, and they were just broken kids.\n\nAt first I wanted my older self to come and help me,\nbut later I just started calling them My Bullies, they never had a chance at a good life.\n\nAnd here we find a sliver of sanity,\nbecause there is something that can be done to control crime.\n\nIt is preventing children from being forced into that desperate mode of existence,\nPREVENTION.\n\nPrevention is a simple thing, Free Home, Free Food, Free Money,\nand Free Tutors, a Real Education.\n\nIt will take a psychologist to identify those who need help,\nit is as simple as that.\n\nNo suffering,\nno harm.\n\nAnd for those of you who are crazy enough to ask who will pay for this,\nlet us call the institution a Bank of Love, right at the Heart of a Country.\n\nThey print only as much money as people need to be taken care of,\nand they pride themselves in the amount of debt that nobody will come to collect.\n\nPrevention, is really about education,\nbecause an educated person can make a lot more than any government can grant them.\n\nSocial Programs, Real Welfare, or Universal Basic Income,\nwill grant a person a Home, a Car, Food, and all the necessities, but they can't pay for extras.\n\nThey'll pay for an education leading up to a Captains License,\nbut not the boat.\n\nPrevention will go a long way to bring the number of prisoners down,\nthese desperate beings are part of our family, it is all of us or none.\n\nWe are a young civilization,\nwe don't have governments that can handle Universal Basic Income.\n\nWe have governments,\nthat can barely handle themselves.\n\nWe can cross this bridge, the bridge where we eliminate poverty, and homelessness, and immense fear and suffering,\nsuffering that draws those who have the courage to keep fighting into addiction so that they don't burst out of pain.\n\nTo get there, to begin growing up as a civilization,\nthose of us who can handle it must take to Books and Audio Books and reach Wisdom.\n\nOnly in your Wisdom can the world begin growing,\nbeyond the noisy mess that desperate, blind and tone deaf career politicians created.\n\nThe youngest of you are going to inherit all these problems,\nbut you will also know that all of these problems are happening due to lack of wisdom.\n\nTreat the cause,\nand the symptoms will subside.\n\nOnly in wisdom,\ncan our civilization advance forward.\n\nPersonal Note,\n\nThose of you who are just learning about the world,\nknow that it is confusing because hardly anything works right.\n\nBe it a be it a Judge, or General, and most shockingly a Jury,\nthey are missing lessons that help them see the world as a Work in Progress.\n\nWe are still building the foundation,\nand we are getting too much interference from our leadership.\n\nLook no further than the complete loss of privacy,\nthis is a function of uneducation and desperation, and blindness.\n\nEnhanced interrogation, is even a more terrifying example,\nthe world has no faith in nations that practice torture.\n\nThe 13th Amendment to Constitution of United States did not end Slavery in Full\nit reads \"Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States\".\n\nYou have a lot of work on your hands,\nand you will have a lot of friends working just as hard as you, and all over the world.\n\nWhile you are still young, take to Adventure Audio Books,\nread them all, and especially pay attention to the part where the adventurer reveals the reason for this quest.\n\nIn less than a Hundred Audio Books that call to you,\nyou will begin becoming wise onward to becoming a great being.\n\nIt is in it self a great adventure,\nand if I may, a Memoir is best written as your life unfolds, it is never too early to start writing.",

time?\n\nBy finding your beginning, of course,\nand then weaving an unbroken thread that makes you rise.\n\nWe are born of chaos and accident, but we are a masterpiece of the Universe,\nthe time required to permute all combinations of chemicals to give rise to life is, long.\n\nWe are here, because as unlikely as life is,\neventually, given enough time, and space, it emerges out of mere chaos and accident.\n\nWhen you look around this planet,\ndespite lateral gene transfer, unstoppable power of selection, we are the only branch that can reach wisdom.\n\nI think it is safe to say that some animals love and care, maybe admire,\nbut unfortunately try as they might Chimpanzees, Dolphins and Elephants can't build cities of thoughts and dreams.\n\nIn a word, we, the emergent intelligent creatures, are:\nrare.\n\nIn two words:\nBeautiful and Rare.\n\nWe have to examine what sets us apart from Chimpanzees ad Dolphins,\nand see what we can weave with it.\n\nIn the misery of cold caves,\nor the torture or concentration camps imagining gods goes a long way.\n\nIn the dark ages of child labor,\nor the sickness of slavery and inequality school goes a long way.\n\nIn the age of Mustard Gas,\nor poverty and disease and hungry rats, a national border goes far.\n\nIn the age of Mutually Assured Destruction,\nCold War and Global Threats, a University education can be useful.\n\nBut in the age of Internet, we enter a new era,\nwhere what imaginary gods, simple schools, crazy borders, and trendy universities bring us, is actually, unimpressive and clunky.\n\nWe grew,\nmy friends, it happened just now, just like that.\n\nA new way of learning:\nAudio Books on The Trail.\n\nNo university lecture,\ncan beat twelve beloved and world celebrated books on the same subject.\n\nUnlike Professors, books will bring you many a message, that you will discover between the lines,\nor in the lines of a companion memoir or biography.\n\nA professor will teach you Nuclear Physics,\nbut he cannot teach you the Love necessary not to participate in weapons research.\n\nA memoir,\nwill.\n\nAll the great books are connected, in the library books on weapons development will be connected to books about suffering in war,\nto books about the promise of World Peace...\n\nAnd if not, then the Librarian will catch you with her smile, before you fall,\nby contrast a Professor's smile is meaningless, if not fake.\n\nProfessors can only interfere with your development,\nno single university covers enough subjects to satisfy you, but a library does.\n\nWhile your Knowledge is a sure path to Wisdom,\nthere is something else, you need.\n\nYou need a taste of Greatness,\nyou will never find it in a University town, never.\n\nThere is but a handful of places on earth that will help you feel it,\nthose are the months long hiking trails found on each continent.\n\nWhen you connect the triumph of adapting to the hardships of a trail,\nin rain in snow...\n\n...to the inheritance of wisdom from books,\nI am sorry to say, that the first thing you will feel is a brief flash rage and tears.\n\nFor how could the Good World and the Professors you once respected betray you,\nby putting you into a little dorm room.\n\nAnd no lecture hall is big enough, or prestigious enough,\nto impress you more than the stars, and the silence, and fragrance of woods.\n\nHow could an old and experienced Professor teach you poetry, better,\nthan your beating heart, on the eve of your first encounter with a Bear, and her cubs.\n\nNo professor could ever reach as deep into your heart,\nas a book of inspirational verse, on that stormy night that you should have stayed in the valley below.\n\nAnd the Greatness of a simple warm morning filled with the fragrance of pine trees with a hint of last evening's bonfire,\nthat thick moist air, as you hand spiritually pushes straight through each page of paper book that you now comprehend better than the author, the day he finished.\n\nHe wrote as a mail sorter, or cast away, or patent clerk, or a star crossed overman,\nbut you read it, as an Emergent Masterpiece of The Universe, a Complete Human Being.\n\nLet the trail,\nbecome your semesters and diplomas and awards, and the returns to it, you never-ending graduation ceremony.\n\nSPEAK OUT,\ndo not let the others live unaware that Universities in their mediocrity have fallen to Nature Trails and Audio Books.\n\nSPEAK OUT,\ndo not let other students aim for a job, their job is to build companies, onwards to becoming Great Leaders.\n\nSPEAK OUT,\ntell them about your rage and tears of being denied a real education that fits you.\n\nSpeak Out,\nspeak out.\n\nIn wisdom, and in certainty of knowing that your path is the correct path,\nit is the path of real results, Wisdom, and Greatness.\n\nThe Trail,\nand that thread, are one and the same.\n\nAnd the grades, every one of your grades will far surpass any and all scales,\nin cold rain, in snow too deep to traverse, in hunger two days out from the next town, upon your arrival you rise to a new height, that no grade can mark.\n\nAfter a few years,\nwhat you have weaved out of your books, will be unbreakable, and so unique as to extend precisely who yo are, far into, who you must become to reach greatness.\n\nA day will come, when you will notice the struggle of authors to rise higher,\nand in sadness discover that you will find fewer and fewer books that move you, eventually where your last book ends.\n\nYour own book,\nwill start.\n\nAnd you will add to the mountain peak you climbed,\nand others will follow, and your book will become their last book, and so on.\n\nThat's how you will know what is real,\nwhat is fake, by taking every important step to the highest of heights and leaving your Soul behind for others to resurrect it when your book comes up.\n\nWorry not, countless others have traveled these roads,\nwisdom is real, it is meaningful, it changes you and others for better, and your book will be irreplaceable and beloved by many.\n\nAnd, no, it is foolish to think that you must become an author to write a book, there are too many of those books already,\nyou only need to become wise to write, there are no critics here, as you cry, the reader will cry, as you climb the next mountain, the reader will triumph with you.\n\nTake your self-education to the trails,\nthe nature will help you slow down and connect with the spirits of the authors stored within the books.\n\nDon't worry, it will be OK,\nso as long as all your steps count as a triumph, your growing up will become an upward slope, and your life will eventually become as beautiful as you.\n\nAnd the last thing a Great Being discovers,\nis the answer to their first big question \"Who am I?\", it will all lay open as you look back from your golden age.\n\nYour path to wisdom intertwined with adventure and great discoveries,\nand bears, and dunes, and Fox Fire, and rain and snow, and softness of moss, and endless seas of fern, open like all the great ideas behind all the most beloved of poems.",

      "text": "Though mighty, we are very delicate creatures,\nour minds require Beauty and Calm to learn the most at their best.\n\nHaste of organized education, threats of losing a 4.0 GPA,\nhomework deadlines, and even subconsciously knowing that memorization is not education, will conspire against us.\n\nLearning for real, real education, useful knowledge,\nthriving wisdom, and eventual greatness demands a beautiful and authentic existence.\n\nIn real life, getting a diploma by cramming, memorizing, winging it or getting lucky,\ndoesn't actually do anything.\n\nReality, demands real things,\ntruth, authenticity, and a healthy existence.\n\nA beautiful life,\nrequires our full beauty.\n\nTo bloom, to truly grow up,\nwe need to be truly free, we need to reside in the real world.\n\nIt is not as easy as it sounds,\nthough we all have the ability to set ourselves free from childhood indoctrination.\n\nWhat about, the less obvious things?\n\nSuch as doing badly on a test some years ago, having your GPA permanently lowered because of it,\nbut on the day of graduation, actually being able to perfectly pass that test, but now during graduation it being too late.\n\nSo you are accepting a lower GPA, so that you can graduate sooner?\nthat is not how reality works, and what about the extra motivation that you would receive from keeping a 4.0 GPA throughout your entire stay?\n\nAnd what about the quality of that test,\nand what about the people that passed it because they memorized it without really learning anything?\n\nAnd what about the fact that that many will never need what was on that test,\nin effect the College or University slowing their progress down, distracting them from learning what would help them become more of themselves.\n\nAnd what about well connected and ingratiated liars, at the company you do end up working at,\nwhat if after years of tests and textbooks and frightening and stressful debt, a liar dislikes you?\n\nReality, will make you strong and beautiful, it will make your life meaningful and full of joy,\nbut you have to keep it real, the education must be real, your place of employment must be stable and honest.\n\nAt no point should you be pushed to the side,\nand forced to walk a path that is different from who you are.\n\nAnd do not forget, that we are granted a set amount of time,\nspending more than 30 years in pursuit of school and career that isn't guaranteed to be what you need, should be a tough proposition.\n\nNow, a real education coupled with a series of business undertakings that you learn from,\nand eventual launch of a successful company based on what you have learned is a lot more stable.\n\nSo, High School, College, University and a Career,\ndoes not hold the same guarantee that Self Education and eventually becoming a Successful Founder, does.\n\nIf you start leaning towards the Start-up Culture in High School,\nyou can start building your companies a lot sooner, and begin isolating and mastering the lessons that you actually need in the right sequence and at the right pace.\n\nJust for the fact that there are no bullies when you learn on your own,\nand zero pressure to memorize, and zero classes that will only distract you from learning what you need, self education is better for your mental health and growing up.\n\nCults and religions are not the only indoctrination,\nthey are just the ones that are trivial to catch.\n\nA Real University, would only feature Great Thinkers, Great Actors and Narrators,\nbut even so, their beautiful performances, though eye catching, would never be as perfectly fitted to you as a series of fine hand-picked audio books.\n\nEven an imaginary perfect-university, cannot match the power of a collection of audio books that you can listen and re-listen stress free,\nas you learn to build you companies and graduate to be able to grasp more and more complex subjects.\n\nLets just face it, being placed in a situation where you must merely memorize things,\nis a sign that you are being taken advantage of.\n\nLearning is not about memorization,\nand memorization has nothing to do with learning.\n\nMemorization is best used in poetry,\nit a way to give thanks to poets.\n\nEven if you memorize numbers of a new language,\nall you have left is a piece of information that is not yet useful.\n\nMemorizing 100 of the most popular words in a language you are learning,\nis almost dangerous as you will have trouble with correct pronunciation.\n\nTo learn a new language, you are best to create a path you can navigate and expand,\nwatch a movie you are already familiar with in your native language, and build a transcript.\n\nWe are good at language,\njust like we are good at dance, don't force it, love it.\n\nYour Knowledge is sacred,\nit empowers your decision making, and helps your dreams come true.\n\nWhen someone barges in forcing you to heartlessly memorize things,\nyou must become very suspicious of their motives.\n\nThe world is poor, there are slick talking people out there with all kinds of issues,\nsometimes they are deans, principals, teachers, and even parents.\n\nYou have to find a way to learn things right,\nI think we all know, that way, is not the school way.\n\nI know you are scared, bad grades, yelling parents, threat of poverty and homelessness,\nbut you see, that won't go away when you graduate by cramming, you are only delaying it.\n\nMoreover, by not becoming educated as soon as you can,\nyou become vulnerable to slick talking attackers, and shitty boyfriends.\n\nIt is damn hard to catch a liar, so hard that we can almost assume that liars always do win,\nit is because in their sickens they learn to exploit our cognitive biases.\n\nThe way to push back against manipulators,\nis to become smarter than they are, and believe you me, this barely takes any effort at all.\n\nAt most, AT MOST, 25 five audio books about modern life,\nthough they must all have a positive ending, they have to be happy books.\n\n25 audio books is like a month of your life,\nand, and, and if I may, it will be one of the most beautiful times of your life.\n\nYou will always return to where you were as you read them,\nso you better go to a nice place, or get in your car get on the longest highway and drive.\n\nYou can either start your life with a heart break,\nor with adventure and audio books.\n\nGrab your friends, tell them to behave,\nand go together.\n\nIf I may make a suggestion, lease stop at every antique store,\nas neat as the knickknacks are going to be, look for the most worn out books.\n\nI found a saintly copy of Robinson Crusoe,\nit fits in my back pocket so perfectly, I can't even.\n\nLook for Jack London, Herman Melville, Daniel Defoe,\nand keep an eye out for works by Friedrich Nietzsche.\n\nUse the paper versions to practice narration, but listen to the audio books,\nthey are often out on Librivox.org for free as most of the classics are in public domain.\n\nThat is all you need, to create an adventure,\na path to somewhere far that hits as many antique stores as you can drive by.\n\nAnd promise to drive carefully,\nyou are not in a hurry.\n\nNow, not everyone is ready to write,\nbut some of you are a lot further along than you think.\n\nBegin by writing a singe compound sentence at a time,\nand that's it, don't press, flow.\n\nJust like dehydration happens, or we sometimes develop vitamin deficiencies,\nand need to pay extra attention to what we put in our bodies.\n\nMy friends, same goes for our minds,\nfear or anxiety will cause you harm, you are not to live in fear of any kind.\n\nDo you know what the symptoms of anxiety are?\n\nImpatience, snapping at small things, thinning hair, wanting to be alone,\nsadness, brain fog, body aches, fatigue, bad sleep habits.\n\nThese are not things that we can fix, you can't take pain killers for body aches from from fear.\n\nBy calling it adventure, I give you a simple choice to make,\nbut it is more than a simple adventure, I am inviting you on a quest away from the toxic sludge of an unexamined life.\n\nIn a way, psychology is a young science,\nit is also the most humble and loving of all the Daughters of Philosophy.\n\nThere aren't too many answers here,\nbut there is something, and I can fit it in a sentence for you.\n\nThe secret to a long and healthy life is:\nHappiness.\n\nI am asking you to move away from fear and other disorders that create countless issues,\nand get on a path towards happiness, because that is a very powerful medicine.\n\nHappiness is quite a thing,\nit is almost on par with wisdom, though I suppose it the end it is one and the same.\n\nWhere wisdom makes you a beautiful writer,\nhappiness makes you a powerful doctor.\n\nThe low key sarcastic, low brow, poker face, dead pan nonsense,\nthat will feature in your journals due to Happiness and Love of Life.\n\nHas the power to bring the most boorish and scared person from the brink of death,\nand plop them in the middle of the Shenandoah Valley, walking stick in one hand and a bewildered companion in the other.\n\nI once wondered how we could describe the most powerful beings on earth,\nand somehow I came up with a two word description that still frightens-me-a-little to this day:\n\nThe Laughing Philosopher.\n\nWhile, I guess, I am not a real doctor, though the results are not quite in yet,\nI am certain that even those who are deeply sad will find something that will bring them a special kind of Happiness when out on an adventure.\n\nAnd I would argue, that the saddest of us, are the least likely to be eaten by a bobcat,\nor dragged away by a condor.\n\nAnd I know for certain, that the saddest of us,\nare the ones that eventually tell the happiest and most triumphant of stories.\n\nAll you need to do, is be aware of the terrible fact,\nthat the first few days of your adventure will feel wrong; you have to snarl through it.\n\nFight the urge to turn the car around,\nthat is just the toxic sludge within you fighting for survival, make sure it loses the battle.\n\nIt will only take a few days,\nand then, everything changes.\n\nOh my, when you get out of your car,\nand your hiking or trail running shoes hit the gravel, it is like hearing bells of kissing a hundred woodland faeries.\n\nBy taking that first detoxified step of your new adventure away from lies, bullies, limits and fears,\nyou can perfectly understand why dogs get zoomies sometimes.\n\nAnd hearing your first chipmunk,\nwill absolutely put all the damn birds to shame.\n\nNo job, or school, or employer, or alarm clock with a creepy snooze button, or any damn thing,\nhas any right to your joy of life - do you hear me?\n\nYou joy of life is sacred,\neverything else has to be secondary.\n\nYou are at your most beautiful, and you contribute to the world the most,\nwhen you are Happy, and occasionally mischievous.\n\nCall it an adventure, or intellectual hygiene,\nbut keep your backpack by the door, and may you be always ready, for the call of the wild.\n\nBecause that will mark the rise of your own personal University,\nand the beginning of your quest for real education and wisdom.",

emphasizing \"she doesn't know\".\n\nWhile not purrfect, this is a really good start,\nand erasing the deadline from its existence, is a sweet-sweet cherry on top.\n\nThere are too more things you could use, a handful or ungrateful friends,\nand a really well thought out backpack, and a large solar charger you can hang on the back.\n\nSee, you are not just headed for Key West and back,\nI m sure you will stop at all the antique stores, and hopefully pawn shops as they have good stuff too.\n\nA good pawn shop somewhere down in Florida or by an ocean is sure to have a cheap Wet Suit,\nit is a little known fact that they aid your buoyancy, it is like wrapping your self in a wee boat.\n\nI think it is really important to consider stopping by the highway accessible State Parks,\nthey are usually there because something beautiful is going on.\n\nYou never know what you find, it could be a little lake, maybe enormous dunes,\nit could be a hill with a historic watchtower of a lookout, or it could be a stable, with horses.\n\nPersonally, I think it is disrespectful for a man to sit on a poor animal,\nbut it is fine for a woman.\n\nAnd you certainly don't want to realize come your late golden age,\nthat you never rode a horse, and yet you always knew that you were a cowgirl at heart.\n\nNow, you see what I am saying, you go from a warm and cozy blanket on a lazy afternoon, facing an ugly week,\nto wondering how to make the damn animal stop galloping, because by now you are in the middle of the woods.\n\nAn hour later as you lead your new equine fiend back,\nit won't be just that you soul and heart are filling with beauty...\n\n...but somehow you will also gain a sense for how irrelevant your deadline was,\nhow nearly falling from your new spirit animal and soul-mate combined to repair your perspective.\n\nIt is never enough to merely dump indoctrination and repair misconceptions,\nthere is also a kind of a fog-of-war that luls you into a life that frankly, you already made too many compromises for.\n\nIn real life you do things out of love, in the other kind of life you compromise,\nand do that long enough and you will find yourself hardly noticing that you are walking a stranger's road - that ain't good.\n\nEventually, you pet and pat you horse, give the caretaker a smile,\nand stop at the next park.\n\nThe more stops you make, the more you will heal and the faster you will catch up with growing up,\nyou can almost feel it in your hands, they will fell empty without a journal.\n\nNow, let me just pause here for a second, and remind you, that you are removing unimportant things from your life,\nbe good to your journal, failing that get a second one, as the first one won't last long at all.\n\nDon't make the same mistake I did, I bought this beautiful leather bound thing,\nand figured why don't I use a pencil at first...\n\n...smart right?\n\nIt took me hours to try to erase the pages, and most of them still had annoying little bits of letters on it,\ntreat your journal like a friend, and speak in wee little bits.\n\nIf you want to speak at length,\ndo what I am doing, give advice, make a little audio file and put it on the internet.\n\nHealing will make it so that you will want to erase it because it will sound \"dumb\" to you after a bit,\nbut that is only because you are growing really quickly, catching up, others still need the simpler thoughts.\n\nA lot of people will stay in bed,\nthey will meet the deadline, and that snooze button will slowly turn their joy of life off.\n\nThere is still hope for them, maybe the boss will be super crazy and mean, hopefully,\nshe could then come around and tell them \"Hey! you will never get a raise again?\", that could still snap them out of it.\n\nBut, if the boss is not fully crazed,\nyou are their last hope.\n\nThe trouble you go through to learn to jog,\nor try to hit every state park, without really caring much for actually making it to Key West.\n\nAs all end of the road towns are tourist traps,\nso, it is true when they say it is the journey, not the destination.\n\nExcept maybe for those six toed cats that Ernest Hemingway left behind in his Key West home,\nvery few things will surprise you with independence, and a cat probably capable of of grasping tools is one of them.\n\nYeah, all the trouble, and little pit stops, and furry or maned discoveries, serve as a call to health,\nto all those who are almost ready for it, but not quite there.\n\nNo human should lead the life of a house cat,\nwe are very dynamic, and doing beautiful unusual things helps us stay healthy.\n\nOne, time, I camped next to a couple that brought their two year old to a hike-in site,\nit was clearly the husband's idea, the wife was angry, and the kid was crying...\n\nIt was a nice try, but they needed more vacations, and more babysitters,\nand not just camping, but jogging, trail running, and a plan to visit all the famous lighthouses.\n\nI am sure she loved the trouble of camping when they started dating,\nnow the inconvenience of it all was making the poor lady, angry, out of the storm of stress.\n\nI am certain, that she was blaming her self for it,\nand thinking of her self as just that kind of a person, nobody is angry like that.\n\nBetween the three of them, they had everything in the universe, except the trouble was so overwhelming and the fog-of-war so thick.\nThat this, clearly, mighty and courageous mom, was only racing forward to get stuff done.\n\nThey stayed the weekend,\nbut they needed at least three weeks if not months.\n\nThey needed to stop racing forward,\nthey needed more adventures, more \"inconvenience\", more trouble-making as I call it.\n\nThat woman in particular struck me as someone who needed to run the Western States 100,\nshe had the power for it, no, she has a soul for it.\n\nSee emanated the mana that bespoke that,\nthe standard marathons needed to qualify for western states meant nothing to her, it was just a blistering formality.\n\nAnyway, still a glorious couple,\nand their little one will surely grow up to be an adventurer.\n\nAside from a raccoon I named Friday, using his cute little hands to soil my hot dog buns,\nthat week brought in another mighty being - this time a teenage boy.\n\nHis father passed away, and he pushed himself too far,\nthe psychologist put him on permanent medicine.\n\nI had the great honor of speaking to him, he told me he slept in fields and ditches,\nbut he had his sister, or mom, looking out for him.\n\nHe was a Powerful Troublemaker,\nI told him we need to care for ourselves, our bodies need vitamins, electrolytes, our minds need whatever they need.\n\n\"There is no such thing as crazy,\nyou just went through a lot in life, it was your life that got crazy.\" - I said to him.\n\nA thousand miles on a bicycle, which according to my maps requires a little trip to Canada, and a ferry,\nis all the proof needed that the kid was really special.\n\nI returned to my camp, and a day or two later,\na shadowy figure visited him, his mom probably, and without me paying attention I've noticed it was a slow and mighty, and very heavy conversation.\n\nKnowing he was well, I hope he continued his bicycling, at least to the upper peninsula,\nthough there was a ferry near by, so maybe he was headed for Chicago, I hope they both went.\n\nSee, here is a child well on his way to become a great being,\nhe was learning wisdom, and all he needed was backpack, a bicycle, and a thousand miles of road.\n\nTrouble-making is no joke, it an art,\nand it is medicine worthy of great heroes.\n\nIf you, my Dear Reader, get stuck, or stung, or scared, or get stuck in a fog of war,\nknow that it is not a time to try harder, and push harder, and let me tell you why without mincing words:\n\nBecause you are absolutely irreplaceable,\nand - what you think your flaws are - aren't, they are not flaws, this is your uniqueness.\n\nYou will only exist once in the universe,\nand though you can rain wrath precisely like a god, you also need to pace yourself.\n\nThe best kind of a Warrior is a Laughing Philosopher,\nnot a Berserker (that's too easy), be an Artist.\n\nIt is a huge part of the art of living,\nto quit blaming yourself for being angry, or clumsy, or never finishing anything you start, or never finding the right person.\n\nYou are not angry, there is nothing wrong with you,\nyou just took on so much weight and made so many compromises that there is no more time left for you to be yourself.\n\nI know it sounds awful when I say something as simple and go ride a bicycle, or a horse,\nor give the campsite raccoons so much anxiety that they start clawing their way into nice people's backpacks.\n\nBut that is how it works, the way out of fog of war,\nmust be simple so that you have no trouble taking it.\n\nNo one is asking you to drop out of school permanently,\nyou're not going to be homeless, you will find a better job.\n\nYou only need to say the truth to your next employer,\nyour mental health, and your joy of life, and a balanced existence is critical to a healthy existence.\n\nJust because someone can lay down their life to meet a deadline whilst kissing ass and never asking for a raise,\nit does not mean anybody healthy will ever try.\n\nIf principals or teachers, or management or anything gets crazy on you,\ndon't quit, just don't comply because doing so will hurt you, just take a vacation, because your mental and physical health is more important than anything else, period.\n\nIf you are still not hearing this, if you are still not ready not to sacrifice yourself,\nlet me say this, there is a lot of people out there who like that Mighty Teenager do have a breaking point that will scare the bajezus out of a shrink, who is only too happy to prescribe something.\n\nYour self-compassion, your dignity, your beauty,\nand the power that your laughter, your foolishness, your silliness, your mischievousness, and above all your giggles exert on the universe that surrounds you is to important to us all for you to keep walking a path that is hurting you.\n\nYou are irreplaceable, and when you rise, and choose to share your stories,\nyou will build roads for others to follow.\n\nBy not putting up with what is hurting you,\nyou make the Universe a better place by becoming a beacon of sanity for those who will hear of your adventures.\n\nReturning to school or job with with this dignity and integrity of mind,\nwill change the way people treat you.\n\nNot just your confidence, but your wisdom, and strength, and balance,\nwill alter your body language.\n\nStressed people and relaxed people, give off different behavioral clues,\npeople including those in charge of budgets can read that very easily.\n\nTerrible people who lack compassion are everywhere,\nsometimes stressed out people will be abused with more stress just because they keep taking it on.\n\nThings get supremely complicated,\nin ways that we can't always understand.\n\nFor example the reason why someone loses their 4.0 may have nothing to do with their performance,\nbut with the teacher giving out too many A/s in the previous semester, and now just trying to average things out with the people who never complain, so that the dean doesn't come around complaining that his class sticks out.\n\nIt doesn't matter if it is High School, or College, or what used to be a Dream Job,\nthere are unethical fake it until you make it people covering their asses everywhere, it is a tragedy that someone like that should become a reason behind someone's years of suffering.\n\nThese are simple examples I am making up,\nin real life, there is no understanding of all the motives as people who never grew up, constantly interact with each other to to do less, and get more,\n\nTrouble-making is just a lighthearted way of leaving all that noise behind,\nand regaining your own beauty, and strengths, and awe for the world around you.\n\nGive yourself some trouble that actually makes you better for a change.\nif the path you re walking on feels wrong, you need to begin preparing an adventure backpack.\n\nA very special Monday is coming around,\nyour clock will go off just like always.\n\nBut this time it will die with a sad whimper as you - slowly and deliberately - unplug it from the wall,\nand return to sleep, not worried about your deadline, job or school, but simply knowing full well, that they don't matter anymore; because your well being is infinitely more important.\n\nThen get into your car, or on a bus, and set a direction for sunny weather,\ndrive, fly, just go, and do not wait to create your rules of adventure, do it as soon as possible.\n\nWhen your health returns to you,\nyou'll know exactly where you are going, and schools will always take you back, and jobs that hurt you are now worthy of your concern at all.\n\nDon't make plans about the rest of your life until you catch up where you need to be and become wiser as think things through.\n\nAnd finally, if you don't like the idea of trouble making,\nthen between You and I let us call it: Love of Life.",

      "text": "All that has ever gone wrong,\nhas gone wrong due to rejecting realities, and accepting, fantasies.\n\nTo deny truth, is to create a terrible fantasy,\nand no human being should ever be committed to one - as life is far too precious.\n\nYes, fantasies in a sickly way are more comfortable,\nthan the authentic life that unfolds by rules independent from our wishes.\n\nBut rejecting pleasant fantasies is no different\nthan the rejection of drugs.\n\nIt is simply not who we are,\nand not where healthy people wish to be, or can possibly grow.\n\nIt is not that the world is too difficult to grasp,\nbut that, too many people are suffering from lack of knowledge.\n\nKnowledge is found in books, best experience in their audio form,\nand on a pleasant and relaxing adventure.\n\nBooks whose authors are admired for their hard work, clarity of long therm vision,\nintelligence, wisdom, and often a wonderful sense of humor.\n\nAlas, far too many people take to relive their fears by,\nby constructing a view of the world they can understand and control.\n\nAll fantasies will eventually call for reinforcement,\nand as history shows, at any, and all cost.\n\nBe it something as tiny as the number of likes on a social network,\nas odd as the status that pointlessly-expensive-cars bring.\n\nOr something as heartbreaking as political systems,\nwhere fathers will easily send their children to kill each other in battle fields.\n\nA fantasy will call for reinforcement,\nto keep it going to make it last, and no price will ever be too big.\n\nReality, is much harsher and not as comfortable or easy to grasp,\nwill call for constant effort, hard earned foresight, real and lasting results to our endeavors, and authentic dignity.\n\nIn reality; color of skin, numbered of colored pieces of paper, or the colors of a flag,\ndo not define who is superior, and who is inferior, who is better and who is worse.\n\nIn fantasy, poverty and war, are facts of life,\nin reality, Love, Health, and World Peace, are, the most beautiful rewards for the most difficult of achievements.\n\nIn fantasy we crated tens of thousands of gods and as many battles in their worship,\nin reality we invent Flight, try to get to the Moon for no clear reason, and even fantasize about Interstellar Travel to cross the galaxy.\n\nIn reality there is no evil, just a steady and colorful progress forward, we build Nuclear Plants and not Nuclear Missiles,\nin fantasy evil oozes from the cracks that mad men must keep patching to prevent their small minds from falling to a thousand pieces.\n\nFantasies spread with culture,\nthey quite imperceptibly trick us into thinking of ourselves as other than we really are.\n\nFor example, if you don't believe you can be a genius,\nyou will not be able to become one, you'll never aim for it.\n\nThe longer you delay, the more obstacles will arise in your path\nif you don't believe you can cross that challenge, you won't even try.\n\nIf you grant others control over your time, or life,\nyou will only limit yourself and how far you can travel.\n\nYour mind is powerful enough to host cities of thoughts and dreams of, any size,\nthe only limit to your intelligence is the ability to mistakenly stop your self by accepting some falsehood.\n\nLove, genius, empathy, foresight and insight, and spirituality exist within us all,\nbut without knowledge and eventual wisdom they too are limited and fall short.\n\nYes, at first, the real world is unknown to us,\nbut it is not meant to frighten us into creating fantasies that we think we can grasp.\n\nIt simply requires that we listen to a hundred books,\ntake a moment to explore the world around us with our new found experience...\n\nAnd then very slowly and very gently as our long lives unfold,\nlisten to, and read, just about nine hundred more as not to ever fall short, and always have a beautiful story to tell.\n\nWe are sure to become wise, with all the building blocks we gain from books,\nand then, if should we wish, we can turn right around and create some new books for others to read, and grow up with.\n\nDo not be scared my friends,\nas scary as poverty is, its power flows precisely from lack of education, wisdom and above all foresight.\n\nThe more knowledgeable and wiser the world,\nthe more overwhelming the force to crush poverty.\n\nGrowing up to become knowledgeable and wise as opposed to merely age in some easy fantasy,\nis critical for our mental health and well being.\n\nA thousand books you can listen to while traveling worlds most beautiful hiking trails,\nis hardly a challenge, it shouldn't even be seen as a inconvenience.\n\nInheriting real and functional knowledge, that has a powerful and lasting impact on our growing up,\nthat enriches and enhances our decision making bringing us clear visions and impossible dreams is a great reward.\n\nBecoming broke, or homeless, never being able to get a job, and being seen as a waste of life,\nis not something that can happen to a wise a beautiful person that rejects fantasies in search of truths.\n\nAnd it is important to remember,\nthat we can't graduate a by cramming and temporary memorizing disconnected facts.\n\nA fake education,\nis a meaningless education.\n\nCompanies known for hiring such inauthentic individuals are full of life draining liars and pretenders and probably in high positions,\nwhatever they build cannot be built with vision and wisdom, it can only self destruct.\n\nOnce you become self educated,\nyou are granted the opportunity to build your own companies with foresight and invention.\n\nMy dear reader, I would bet building an open and grade-free school that actually educates its students will be high up on your to-do list.\n\nBuilding companies only becomes stressful when you build them for their own sake due to lack of vision,\nwhen you enter on the path towards wisdom, you won't merely aim to impress investors, you will move generations.\n\nIt is OK to blindly set off towards wisdom,\nit is one of the few leaps of faith that are worth the while.\n\nWhatever your aims, may you inspire countless dreamers to greatness,\nand may you reject all fantasy, holding authenticity and wisdom as the highest of values.",

      "text": "Education in the context of an individual is the path to wisdom and greatness,\nin the context of the whole world, however, education is a path to World Peace.\n\nEducation is a very unusual thing,\nit enhances everything it can touch.\n\nTo borrow from movies,\neducation is our loading program.\n\nTo borrow from computers,\neducation is our operating system.\n\nWithout education, we reset back to some 20,000 or 50,000 years ago,\nwe end up living in villages and inventing gods to help with harvest and afterlife.\n\nOrganized and mandatory education is a recent invention,\nit works up to middle school where teachers begin hiding inexperience behind abstractions.\n\nWhen teaching a class of multiple students there is only time for lowest common denominators,\neverything gets hurried along and those who can't understand something begin memorizing.\n\nWithin a few years everyone is temporarily memorizing everything to be sure they graduate,\nthose who try to learn, are graded down under the threat of being held back and repeating the year.\n\nNobody is learning anything useful, everyone is memorizing,\nand teachers, grades, and threats of being held back only reinforce memorization.\n\nThat is not education,\nthat is memorization, acting.\n\nOur loading program does not load,\nour operating system does not initialize.\n\nSystem crashes,\nand fathers eagerly send their boys to kill boys of other fathers.\n\nPolitics becomes infested with pretenders, actors, con-men, and simple liars,\nvoters simply don't think about electing people who show wisdom, who share books.\n\nLack of modern knowledge and the stress it begets will slow people down,\nit will be difficult to become wise, it may not be possible to become great.\n\nFailure to propagate modern knowledge, seems to take the shape of,\nan uneducated majority, and a tiny educated minority without any voting power.\n\nOnce the failure of education takes hold,\nnothing can be done to fix the anomalies that occur afterwards.\n\nThe only way to help things along is to avoid the emergence of anomalies in the first place,\nand that means having a functional educational system.\n\nIf it is not possible for a nation to teach its children,\nif the dream of organized, mandatory and standardized education is not realistic.\n\nPersonalized computer based, self education must be put in its place,\nthe transition can be made easy by transitioning from grades to money, credits, or bonds.\n\nThe initial computer based curricula would grow the same way the world encyclopedia did,\na little bit at a time, from all directions, as students are rewarded for following their curiosities.\n\nI write this in year 2020 when it seems that all our old mistakes have reemerged,\nbut what is actually going on is that mis-educated people are self assembling into desperate groups.\n\nWe are seeing groups self-reinforcing each other's beliefs based on color of skin,\nthey come together to form communities because of an imaginary superiority a color.\n\nWe have a nation that treats women with he permanent legal status of a minor,\nof someone who is less than 18 years old, and politicians do not know to become enraged by this.\n\nWe have two nations that feature concentration camps,\nand the Land of the Free that practices torture under the guise of enhanced interrogation.\n\nAll of this is happening because of failure of schooling,\ninability of politicians to build.\n\nNow, let me close with a heart warming thought experiment,\nwhich deep down I hope some magnificent nation a thousand years in the future may try for real.\n\nWe can all agree that, education is an investment in a nation's future,\nand that pretending to teach children by forcing them into memorization can destroy a nation.\n\nLet us say that, in this thought experiment, unless a better program is in place,\ncountries should pay their students for achievement, not with imaginary letters but with real money.\n\nStudents in elementary should be getting paid just as much money as college students,\nand the amount that they bring home should be equal that of a prestigious job.\n\nAfter all what is more prestigious than the child's real knowledge,\na child will soon become a politician, investor, leader, and inspiration for others to follow.\n\nMaking some $200,000 a year in 2020 money, is an amazing way for a nation to show respect its students,\nand it will proudly display how much more important they are in proportion to the defense budget.\n\nGraduation, would leave a student not with crippling debt that can't be erased with bankruptcy,\nbut with just about $3.2 million dollars in their account, that is how a graduate should start life.\n\nThe cost of this is irrelevant, these are hundreds of trillions of dollars per year that simply add to our national debt,\nthis is what it means to have a country.\n\nWhat we see today, is poverty, children going hungry, fake education, ineffective politics,\nand research and legalization of dangerous drugs for the purpose of erasing stress, and PTSD born from poverty.\n\nWe cannot allow ourselves to live in the fantasy land,\nwhere it is OK for one nation to teach their children that another needs to be destroyed.\n\nWe cannot allow ourselves to live in the fantasy of a limited number of abstract virtual pieces of paper,\nthat sometimes make children die of starvation.\n\nHumanity, has outgrown the type of primitive small town thinking that we see today,\nit has outgrown it probably more than a hundred years ago when large cities started growing.\n\nFor those of you who are still laughing at my though experiment,\ntake a lesson from the way early internet social networks would reform themselves.\n\nInitially switching to more automated, more statistics and probability oriented systems,\nwould set their platforms on fire and cause waves of disturbance, but that is how things adapt to growing larger.\n\nCall it growing pains, call it Love of Humanity, call it a nation at a stand still,\nin process of not just erasing poverty but creating an overabundance of wealth for its students.\n\nOut of Love and Wisdom,\nout of Greatness of Vision, and of yearning for other nations to follow onward to World Peace, Safety and Equality.\n\nAnd my final words are a question, if you created a thought experiment that represented the sad state of affairs today,\nwhat would that thought experiment be about, and what would it be trying to prove?",

think most people assume that switching cultures\nmeans living in some other country for a but moving around is just as good.\n\nThe point is not to be glued to a single spot,\nbut continue adapting to as many as possible.\n\nMoreover, changing the way we live is just as good,\nspending half a year traveling the Appalachian Trail is the most powerful example.\n\nAbove all, going to sleep when it gets dark, and rising to watch the sun rise,\nis a great treasure, that brings great heath and strength.\n\nGoing forward every day, and slowing down to match the pace of nature,\nhelps people have long thoughts and connects all their dots together.\n\nDiscomfort, is not part of learning and growing, or healing,\nit is just that we must not succumb to fear and imaginary dragons.\n\nDoing new things is not perfect, but it is not discomfort,\ndiscomfort is when someone is hurting you, or life is crushing you.\n\nThese are the situations that require drastic changes,\nnot just a set of changes, but a long term series of changes.\n\nSome people, presumably at-least armchair psychologists,\nsay that we end up using a more logical side of our brain...\n\nBut, I am sure that our brains are infinitely more complex than that,\nand what is actually going on is that we are leaving a kind of depression behind.\n\nOne of our main missions in life, is to live it to its fullest because, life is precious,\nand that includes living in balance with nature, wisdom, and universe.\n\nAnd while, I do admit that this sounds a wee bit hokey,\nthe best way to personally explore ideas behind heath and balance.\n\nIs to try to imagine our elder selves,\nat say, 85 and a half years, young.\n\nIt is hard to deny that, no one is more connected to the elder you, than you right now,\nyou can try to project your predispositions and try to imagine what the elder you is like.\n\nOur energy is found in balanced living,\nwe have to move away from stress, and depression, and overwork.\n\nOur intelligence, and creativity, our memory, and ability to learn, and read books,\nrequires that we take really good care of ourselves.\n\nIn school and at work, you will find your self facing,\nwhat I would call Profit Optimization.\n\nMediocre teachers will want a perfect mediocre score,\nthat is slightly above their last year statistics so that they may show improvement.\n\nThe average employer will want you to do more for less,\nor to get more out of you, without investing more into you.\n\nAnd that means,\npushing you past your healthy balance.\n\nEncouraging use of medications that help with temporary memory at school,\nand whatever pushes you into overwork and over performing at work.\n\nIf you don't do that,\nyou will be replaced by someone who is willing to live sick for the minimum you got paid, or less.\n\nAllow me to digress, and say that to deal with both of these issues in a healthy fashion,\nyou can self-educate and and aim to build a serious of start-ups.\n\nNow, when building your companies, you will be tasked with not pushing yourself,\nwhile it is easier to overwork in short term, it is not worth it in long term.\n\nYou need heart, and soul, and long visions and thoughts to craft your own future,\nand being stressed, depressed, and overworked will only take those powers away from you.\n\nLiving healthy should be the easiest thing for you, cramming, overworking, stressing, depressing,\nand squeezing every last bit of energy out of yourself, aught to be the more difficult path.\n\nJust listen to what I am saying;\nwhen you are healthy and in balance with your self, or with nature, whatever you conceive to be:\n\nYou are at your most intelligent, and most creative, and strongest self,\nyou are also most beautiful, and I am sure at your funniest, in that worst of ways where no one is sure if are joking or dead serious.\n\nOne of the ways to connect with your elder self,\nis to make them better, is to grant them outrageous gifts from your youth.\n\nEven if just to remind them,\nwho the boss really is, or to make them smile in wonder.\n\nGreat beings often appear slightly odd and confusingly funny, just because of that,\nthey are sending a message into their own future, to guarantee the health of their elder selves.\n\nCulture switching helps a person become unstuck,\nit exposes them to new experiences, and removes old discomforts, and often making them more courageous.\n\nIt is important to read books, and that means to live in a state that is conducive to inheriting lifetimes of knowledge,\nand that state just can't be found at places that aim to push you out of balance for their own profit.\n\nIt sounds terrible, but this is just a call to rising, to self balancing, to becoming an independent thinker,\nto leaving all influences whether perceptible of obscured, behind you, in a blur of a series of challenges.\n\nWith each new step,\nyou will learn new things.\n\nWith each new culture,\nyou will become more illuminated.\n\nAnd with each Great Endeavor,\nyou will become, greater.",

from experience - will hold up.\n\nBut they will dismiss the future entirely,\nbecause to speak of the future; a person needs a direction, a vision, an objective, a purpose, a wisdom.\n\nMen of experience, are too small minded, too blind and limited, to shallow, to fragile,\nto see into things that have no impact on them.\n\nOur levels of education are insufficient to directly address the problems that we face today,\nthere are too few well educated, knowledgeable and wise beings to repair anything right now.\n\nAn uneducated voting majority is all to easily swayed and misled,\nand our poverty will prevent our generation from re-learning.\n\nOne of the worst things about general poverty,\nis that it induces a poverty of mind, out of lack of time, out of stress, fear, and discomfort.\n\nReality, has no borders, as climate change and pandemics show us,\nin reality we are one human family.\n\nAnd in reality, poverty is tearing the world apart,\nit is keeping us weak.\n\nIn reality, a teenager in a dictatorship on the other side of the world,\nis your friend, they would love you if you sent them popular snacks from your city, some photos and music.\n\nThey are family,\nthere are people out there who would be genuinely kinder to you than some of your own family.\n\nIt is sooooo sad that we label each other with the names of our nations,\nand return to tend to whatever poverty we are facing at the moment.\n\nInternet, student exchange, programs like Peace Corps,\nand documents like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights help us see in our confused state.\n\nBut it is just a tiny sliver of light,\npoverty of mind alone is almost unaffected by it.\n\nUnited Nations has its hands tied,\nwithout an appropriate level of education General Assembly will stand in a constant state of disagreement.\n\nWithout a plan to unite, and eliminate poverty,\nwe are all equally wrong.\n\nAnd we can't have Unity and Prosperity without Knowledge and Wisdom,\nliars would instantly invent something that they stand to lose, and tear the world right up.\n\nDo you hear me, do you see what I am saying,\nwe are one, it is all of us, or none.\n\nThe way to fix it,\nis by inventing educational programs that really help children to knowledge, wisdom and greatness.\n\nBecause until we hold long term visions fueled by Knowledge and Wisdom,\nthe only thing we can agree on, is what the liars want us to believe in.\n\nReal education is the thing that leads us to have thoughts independent to what is on TV and in News Papers,\nit helps us see who the liars, and mark my words for this sorry year, even when they assume a pleasing shape.\n\nReal Education grants us Intellectual Independence,\nwhere audio book by book we all independently gain a valid grasp on reality.\n\nOrganized education will always bend under the threat of being defunded or kept in poverty,\nit will help to invent brand name institutions that are only better in the name, but all equally ineffective.\n\nOrganized education will rip talent out of children, it will sand it down until they are all equally lost,\nmixed with poverty most parents won't even be granted the ability to care about what is happening to the minds of their children, because the babysitting is good.\n\nOrganized education ends up causing harm to children's intellectual development,\nit holds them back and causes so much stress that it is impossible to learn.\n\nOrganized education is such a problem, that even the best minds of our generations,\nare still thinking about \"Free College\" - about paying those fraudulent institutions - instead of funding ones that are capable of Real Education.\n\nThings are pretty bad, thankfully, we are infinite in our capacity to deal with real dangers,\nespecially the ones that tear tear our family apart.\n\nReal education is based on students' predispositions,\nand curiosities.\n\nFor example, when someone is interested in the moon or stars at night,\nthat marks an entry point into Science Fiction, Astrophysics, Astrography and if they continue to care, Optics, Mathematics, Physics, Writing and so on.\n\nMost children won't care for stars very long, because they are interested in exploring all of the universe,\nand that is even better because then there is a multitude of passage ways they can use to walk through the sciences.\n\nBut it has to be their own walking, their own direction, and at their own pace,\nwe have to honor their predispositions and curiosities, the students are the future.\n\nWe have to remove grades, tests, graduation, class rooms, time divisions, subject divisions, rows of seats, groupings of any kind be it age or area of study,\nwe have to replace the teacher with personalized learning and tutors.\n\nAnd we have to give the students what they need, a telescope, a fast single board computer with all the sensors and servos they could ever need,\nthey need the ability to launch satellites, to operate small remotely operated submarines and small drones, they need access to things they are curious about.\n\nIf a student is walking the wrong path, then it is a path that has been been walked many times before, they are asking a question, and they need powerful answers,\nthey have to see what war is like, what prisons are like, what concentration camps are like - and what love is like - and they will learn.\n\nAt the time of writing this in 2020, I realized that there are three nations that operate concentrations camps,\nwhich is probably to say, that there are many; and they need to see that too.\n\nThey need to see gang violence, and if they are still around then meet up with Father Gregory Boyle's boys,\nfor they have surely become Great Beings.\n\nNothing goes wrong in real education,\nreal education is about reality, about really growing up, and really being human.\n\nAnd when these students grow up, become voters, Senators and Congresswomen and Congressmen,\nthen the liars, and pretenders, will lose their hold on humanity.\n\nAnd then the members of General Assembly of United nations,\ncan finally have their day, in agreement and unity.\n\nMy friends,\nnever lose hope.\n\nIf something important can't happen today,\nit only means that you are to begin building the bridge, for others to eventually get there.\n\nReal Education is the first step,\nthe second is actually many overlapping steps that will happen all at once, all around the world.\n\nWhat you have to do is make sure that the students get to own or hold in their own hands the many tools that they need,\nto learn, and explore the Human Condition, and The Sciences, and The World, and The Stars; as those are their countless bookmarks and the steppingstones to their boundless steps.\n\nThe children want to learn,\nand that is all the hope Humanity will ever need.",

you for your Great Achievements.\n\nThe diploma you receive at the end of your stay in school,\nwhile it grants you access to higher institutions and more advanced jobs...\n\n...it will not prevent those jobs from endangering or sacrificing you for profit,\nthe best lies are the ones that others maneuver you into believing, choices you would never make without their poison.\n\nYour life, does not compare to other lives, no matter how precious or numerous,\nthere is no Life Arithmetic.\n\nThe closest you can get to a formula is this wonderful contradiction:\nEach life is more important than the other.\n\nIf someone ever asks you to do something for the greater good, you are not sacrifice,\nyou quit your job or await your dishonorable discharge, and begin your search for Enlightenment and Wisdom, onward to becoming a Great Being.\n\nIf the best job you can possibly get, holds some measure of risk,\nthen you are going to need to try harder.\n\nIn case you are wondering,\n- I care, and you can't undo that.\n\nThe harder, or the less worn path,\nis that of becoming an Independent Inventor and Entrepreneur.\n\nAnd you are not going to be the first or only one,\nfind the others, find a couple of co-founders, learn from your Noble Failures as well as Triumphant Successes.\n\nSo when someone says \"Diploma\",\nyou reply; \"Check Your Premise\", to quote an old friend.\n\nWhen they say calculator,\nyou say: \"Help me with programming not memorizing formulas.\"\n\nWhen they box you in to memorize,\nyou get the others to drop the class, because you need a real education, one that helps you to wisdom and greatness.\n\nWhile governments are smart enough to encourage learning,\nas evidenced by mandatory education, they are not smart enough to tell a real education from a fake one.\n\nI suspect the intelligence of governments is dictated purely by the voters,\nin that wise people will not vote in uneducated representatives.\n\nBut you see the small catch-22 or egg and chicken problem,\na government can't easily become intelligent enough to encourage real education, without majority of voters being educated for real.\n\nThe way to do boot the process and hopefully sustain it,\nis to mirror the educational paths of pioneers and founders, in a short: Self Education.\n\nSelf education is not that outrageous,\nthat is what real schools are supposed to encourage you to do, without any interference.\n\nAnd let me underline that interference will destroy self education,\ngrades, cookie cutter curricula, the threat of repeating classes or even semesters can destroy a beautiful and delicate mind.\n\nSelf education is like learning to walk, except this time you learn to move in the Universe,\nand instead of getting your feet to move quite right, you are trying to find the audio books that somewhat fit what you already know.\n\nFinally on a related subject, it hurts me to say it, but \"Free College\" is not quite right,\nit should be \"Free Real and Effective Education that Shows Real Results\"\n\nCompare that to the an Important Vaccine, we don't need a mere Free Shot of Something spelled out with weasel words,\nwe need a real and effective vaccine that shows real results across millions of participants.\n\nYou should not allow yourself to think of College or University as something that gets you a good job,\na good job is nothing, the dumbest of liars can get you fired if you get in their way.\n\nThe thing you must look for is Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness,\nas that opens all the gateways ahead of you; but more importantly that path is most worthy of you, it is the most human and healthiest of paths.\n\nAll you need to start is a small bowl of ice cream, an electric blanket, a fine pillow, a comfy bed,\nand a narrated book by Carl Sagan, or Neil deGrasse Tyson, or Bill Bryson.\n\nAnd then as you get going, and maybe take to liking new titles from best-seller lists and new authors you have never heard of,\nfind a a small, perhaps, pocket sized, well respected book on Bush Craft, and start getting ready for your first tiny venture into the Wild by buying a backpack and a tent...\n\nYou will need a pair of cut proof gloves, a 16\" Bowie knife (don't do 14\"), get high quality Damascus, Stag Horn Handle, fine leather sheath, full tang, obviously...\nand a second actually useful Bush Craft Knife, and then splurge on a sharp fordable hand saw you can bring along to all adventures, and get an audio book, and fire going as everyone else is still hacking away.\n\nAs you read more and more,\nand things start making sense, as you slowly and independently begin forming an accurate view of the world.\n\nBring a cheerful friend, or your mum, to a near by state park,\none with a fine beach and a tidy nick-knack store that also doubles as a hot dog stand and perhaps serves a fine and spicy vegetarian alternative.\n\nLater on, grab couple of lovely and trusting friends,\nfool enough to try to through-hike the Applachin Trail with you in one go from Springer Mountain to Mount Katahdin.\n\nThough I highly recommend section hiking at first,\nand also, please, please, visit Henry at Walden Pond each time you climb Katahdin.\n\nYou know, it is hard to miss the fact that a tent in bear country makes for a fine dorm room,\nand that each white blaze you meet on the AT, doubles as an A+ that no teacher could possibly give you.\n\nAnd that each time you make it up Katahdin with a hundred new books on your mind,\nyou do graduate ever higher.\n\nI think both Henry and the Mountain grant you some of their height\n- I know for certain without a doubt; and I know you can feel it too: You are meant to become a Great Being.",
