where each program relies on the other for valid information.

Cities are powered by institutions, and when institutions go bad,
the entire city suffers; similar to how a computer will begin misbehaving.

The central processing unit of an institution, is people working within its walls,
it is a human powered computer, unlike machines, human based computers can self-repair.

A small and common example of a Human Powered computer is the...</p>

and finally put an end to ideas like listen and repeat and short term memorization.

The first and foremost is the elimination of grades,
which also means elimination of standardized testing.

There cannot be such a thing as a Standard Human,
with a standard mind, it is very foolish to think that.

The second is the division of subjects,
and that is no different than browsing the World Encyclopedia.

will choose their own path through...</p>

that begins, with what is interesting to us.

It&#39;s how Human Beings progress forward,
it&#39;s how Socrates, DaVinci, Bruno, Newton, became known.

They followed a path as dictated by their mind,
and that dictation occurs, once precise layer after another.

You can become a genius within 10 years,
but this is not a race, it is best to take 30 years.

Thirty is perfect.

they are exactly as worthless as you think they...</p>

I dreamt that schools were totally, completely fake,
and that the future of the whole world was at stake.

They became fake because they never could teach,
no teacher has ever had that kind of reach.

Eventually it just became all make believe,
and school became a real thief.

It stole Knowledge from you,
it did it to get teachers paid through.

Most assumed, you...</p>

Greece! 425 BC,
to see about a real teacher, having a walk with his students by the sea.

Everyone else was stuck in their own life,
and Socrates too in his own way, was contemplating strife...

But he made a big breakthrough,
as he understood, how he grew.

It was all the lessons he was adding together,
