           <div class="card-text pt-5"><section>
  <p>Without reading powerful books written by wise beings,</p>
  <p>all we can really do is come up with half-baked conspiracy theories.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Does High School work?</p>
  <p>or does it destroy creativity, uniqueness, and self esteem.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Does college work?</p>
  <p>Or is everyone participating in a mutually beneficial dog an pony show?</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Are we supposed to just get a job? or or build a career?</p>
  <p>And what about Start-ups and Entrepreneurship and Invention?</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>These questions matter, if you are in highs school,</p>
  <p>and high school isn&apos;t working, or working out...</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Then what actually is going on,</p>
  <p>is that you are falling behind on knowledge and wisdom.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>It is not that high school becomes easy or irrelevant when it is ineffective,</p>
  <p>but that all this knowledge that would give you more insight into the world, is stolen from you.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Without that empowering knowledge;</p>
  <p>a good grasp on the human condition, a good intuition for liars, manipulators and cheaters.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Without being well grounded in reality, we&apos;ll be forced into desperation,</p>
  <p>into confusion, and all to easily swayed from the paths that we want to walk on.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>With a real education, you can operate an online business,</p>
  <p>or write software, or become an art fanatic and illustrator without any upfront investment.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>You gain so much support from what you can do,</p>
  <p>that poverty ceases to be frightening, and you are allowed to develop further.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>In school we face this notion of grades and GPA that somehow belittles us,</p>
  <p>and then we are led through a standardized education under the banner of balance.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>A musician has little interest in biology beyond what a pleasant to read book provides,</p>
  <p>in the world of grades it can only distract and hurt, and interrupt their self education.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>And yet it appears, that grades exist primarily for getting more funding,</p>
  <p>and they are fake, vague, and likely artificially manipulated to show progress.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Participating in nonsense,</p>
  <p>can only beget more nonsense.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <hr>
</section>

<section>
  <p>It is exhausting to try to figure all this out.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>But think of a religious college, that puts science second to their particular religion,</p>
  <p>think of a diploma mill, and all the colleges that ended up losing accreditation for questionable practices.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Think about all the happy students, all the hard working teachers,</p>
  <p>all the nice ladies that made little jokes and loved the students they worked with.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>And consider this,</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>The most complex of lies exist not just simply for gains,</p>
  <p>but also because it is highly impossible or cost prohibitive to prove wrong doing, and down right impossible to prove ill intent.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>No university professor ever receives an email about now being able to pawn his loose-leaf &quot;books&quot; on the students,</p>
  <p>no dean ever asks the professors to let the students cram so that the college can keep their averages high and their accreditation.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>These things are implied, assumed, and above all,</p>
  <p>part of the very foundation of a for-profit-non-profit that has lobbied not to forgive student loans due to bankruptcy.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <hr>
</section>

<section>
  <p>There is only one way to answer these questions,</p>
  <p>and that is to listen to and perhaps read five to fifteen books on each of these subjects.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>We must not allow ourselves to be misled into a life of un-education, and desperation,</p>
  <p>a school that can&apos;t provide results better, than you listening to a few dozen audio-books on some fantastic adventure, is worthless.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>The first few years after school should be about us trying to build our own businesses,</p>
  <p>to see is there is perhaps something better than being overworked for the rest of our lives.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Entrepreneurship is not something that we can memorize,</p>
  <p>ideas behind our undertakings have to come from our hearts and souls.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>We need a real education for it,</p>
  <p>if school is not helping us to our independence, then we must switch to self education.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Years go by pretty quickly when we aren&apos;t progressing forward,</p>
  <p>and life has a way of getting ahead of us and challenging us with complexity.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>I can&apos;t tell you is schools work or not,</p>
  <p>though I am certain that education is life long.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>And I can&apos;t pick your books for you,</p>
  <p>because only you know the questions that call to you.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>But I know that books and especially narrated books and video lectures, that you arrange in a sequence that agrees with you,</p>
  <p>and watch at the pace that works best for you, are a powerful way to gain knowledge and to step ever closer to wisdom, and without any distractions.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>We owe it to ourselves to find books that help us away from mediocrity,</p>
  <p>and help us inherit lifetimes of functional wisdom towards authenticity and independence.</p>
