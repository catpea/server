  <p>Just because the world is being tardy,</p>
  <p>it does not mean you should be too.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>In deed, if you fail to slowly make haste,</p>
  <p>then the world will become darker for it.</p>

  <p>Every Human must shine,</p>
  <p>with Enlightenment.</p>

  <p>I know it is hard to accept</p>
  <p>that schools may not be working.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We all have so little,</p>
  <p>and now even more even rugs are pulled from beneath our feet.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>There is other stuff too,</p>
  <p>from bad parenting to mutually assured destruction.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I am sorry, if you are looking for answers,</p>
  <p>the best answers any of them will ever give you is: &quot;How were we supposed to know?&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

<div class="section">
  <p>A solid foundation in reality is a good start in life,</p>
  <p>sometimes we don&apos;t figure things out until it is too late.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I know this poem caught you early,</p>
  <p>you have a long time to ponder all this.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And that too is a good start,</p>
  <p>a proper Gentlelady or Gentleman questions everything, and takes nothing for granted.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

<div class="section">
  <p>I hope you are still in Middle School or High School,</p>
  <p>and you get to walk to your desk, with a heavy step.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Slouch, perk up your ears like a Lion,</p>
  <p>and take the whole situation apart.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The kids in the back figured it out already,</p>
  <p>but that is as far as they got, they need more answers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>They need you!</p>
  <p>the leader.</p>

  <p>Maybe you can try thinking about debates,</p>
  <p>learning from the way Great Beings argue the pretenders or the uneducated.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You are already given reasons,</p>
  <p>now you need to find the truth.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is never too early,</p>
  <p>to begin to question everything.</p>

  <p>One of the smallest arguments we are given, is the argument for mathematics,</p>
  <p>well, it used to be given, it was that we aren&apos;t always going to have a calculator on hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Though it is cute to say that we have smart phones with calculators that have advanced mode,</p>
  <p>there is a darker side to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Mathematics is not enough,</p>
  <p>we need Programming, and we need to be Shell Literate as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Vapid and Insipid Mathematics poisoned the beauty of Science,</p>
  <p>memorization of formulas obscured the simpler beauty beneath.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Memorization is another problem,</p>
  <p>look how carefully you are nudged to abandon reason and understanding in favor of memorization.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The guillotine of failing a class because you tried to learn everything,</p>
  <p>instead of passing with a straight A+ for merely cramming for the test - DOES chop your head off.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Look how proud your teacher is, that disingenuous show of teeth,</p>
  <p>up for another raise, sold you for a paycheck and on some simple memes that you can get from a calendar.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>One of the biggest reasons given to you,</p>
  <p>is that you need a Diploma to get a Job.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I would like you to consider, that perhaps a real diploma,</p>
  <p>is one that a University goes out of their way to give; you for your Great Achievements.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The diploma you receive at the end of your stay in school,</p>
  <p>while it grants you access to higher institutions and more advanced jobs...</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>...it will not prevent those jobs from endangering or sacrificing you for profit,</p>
  <p>the best lies are the ones that others maneuver you into believing, choices you would never make without their poison.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Your life, does not compare to other lives, no matter how precious or numerous,</p>
  <p>there is no Life Arithmetic.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The closest you can get to a formula is this wonderful contradiction:</p>
  <p>Each life is more important than the other.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>If someone ever asks you to do something for the greater good, you are not sacrifice,</p>
  <p>you quit your job or await your dishonorable discharge, and begin your search for Enlightenment and Wisdom, onward to becoming a Great Being.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>If the best job you can possibly get, holds some measure of risk,</p>
  <p>then you are going to need to try harder.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>In case you are wondering,</p>
  <p>- I care, and you can&apos;t undo that.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The harder, or the less worn path,</p>
  <p>is that of becoming an Independent Inventor and Entrepreneur.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And you are not going to be the first or only one,</p>
  <p>find the others, find a couple of co-founders, learn from your Noble Failures as well as Triumphant Successes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>So when someone says &quot;Diploma&quot;,</p>
  <p>you reply; &quot;Check Your Premise&quot;, to quote an old friend.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>When they say calculator,</p>
  <p>you say: &quot;Help me with programming not memorizing formulas.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>When they box you in to memorize,</p>
  <p>you get the others to drop the class, because you need a real education, one that helps you to wisdom and greatness.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>While governments are smart enough to encourage learning,</p>
  <p>as evidenced by mandatory education, they are not smart enough to tell a real education from a fake one.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I suspect the intelligence of governments is dictated purely by the voters,</p>
  <p>in that wise people will not vote in uneducated representatives.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But you see the small catch-22 or egg and chicken problem,</p>
  <p>a government can&apos;t easily become intelligent enough to encourage real education, without majority of voters being educated for real.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The way to do boot the process and hopefully sustain it,</p>
  <p>is to mirror the educational paths of pioneers and founders, in a short: Self Education.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Self education is not that outrageous,</p>
  <p>that is what real schools are supposed to encourage you to do, without any interference.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And let me underline that interference will destroy self education,</p>
  <p>grades, cookie cutter curricula, the threat of repeating classes or even semesters can destroy a beautiful and delicate mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Self education is like learning to walk, except this time you learn to move in the Universe,</p>
  <p>and instead of getting your feet to move quite right, you are trying to find the audio books that somewhat fit what you already know.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Finally on a related subject, it hurts me to say it, but &quot;Free College&quot; is not quite right,</p>
  <p>it should be &quot;Free Real and Effective Education that Shows Real Results&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Compare that to the an Important Vaccine, we don&apos;t need a mere Free Shot of Something spelled out with weasel words,</p>
  <p>we need a real and effective vaccine that shows real results across millions of participants.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You should not allow yourself to think of College or University as something that gets you a good job,</p>
  <p>a good job is nothing, the dumbest of liars can get you fired if you get in their way.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The thing you must look for is Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness,</p>
  <p>as that opens all the gateways ahead of you; but more importantly that path is most worthy of you, it is the most human and healthiest of paths.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>All you need to start is a small bowl of ice cream, an electric blanket, a fine pillow, a comfy bed,</p>
  <p>and a narrated book by Carl Sagan, or Neil deGrasse Tyson, or Bill Bryson.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And then as you get going, and maybe take to liking new titles from best-seller lists and new authors you have never heard of,</p>
  <p>find a a small, perhaps, pocket sized, well respected book on Bush Craft, and start getting ready for your first tiny venture into the Wild by buying a backpack and a tent...</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You will need a pair of cut proof gloves, a 16&quot; Bowie knife (don&apos;t do 14&quot;), get high quality Damascus, Stag Horn Handle, fine leather sheath, full tang, obviously...</p>
  <p>and a second actually useful Bush Craft Knife, and then splurge on a sharp fordable hand saw you can bring along to all adventures, and get an audio book, and fire going as everyone else is still hacking away.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>As you read more and more,</p>
  <p>and things start making sense, as you slowly and independently begin forming an accurate view of the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Bring a cheerful friend, or your mum, to a near by state park,</p>
  <p>one with a fine beach and a tidy nick-knack store that also doubles as a hot dog stand and perhaps serves a fine and spicy vegetarian alternative.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Later on, grab couple of lovely and trusting friends,</p>
  <p>fool enough to try to through-hike the Applachin Trail with you in one go from Springer Mountain to Mount Katahdin.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Though I highly recommend section hiking at first,</p>
  <p>and also, please, please, visit Henry at Walden Pond each time you climb Katahdin.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You know, it is hard to miss the fact that a tent in bear country makes for a fine dorm room,</p>
  <p>and that each white blaze you meet on the AT, doubles as an A+ that no teacher could possibly give you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And that each time you make it up Katahdin with a hundred new books on your mind,</p>
  <p>you do graduate ever higher.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I think both Henry and the Mountain grant you some of their height</p>
  <p>- I know for certain without a doubt; and I know you can feel it too: You are meant to become a Great Being.</p>
