  <p>We can&apos;t stand up to corruption,</p>
  <p>if we are not knowledgeable enough to see where it is.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Working towards good grades rather than Empowering Wisdom,</p>
  <p>actually works to shield what is broken about the world today.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Only real and meaningful, functional and powerful-education can grant us the tools needed,</p>
  <p>if we don&apos;t have the necessary tools for thinking then we can&apos;t see enough.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>One of Humanity&apos;s greatest challenges is in overcoming,</p>
  <p>this ridiculous notion of minimum lowest-common-denominator education.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We are each to stand in relentless pursuit of excellence,</p>
  <p>education is life long, volitional, deliberate and life saving.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The future of Earth depends on it,</p>
  <p>many of us have felt the threat of Cold War and Mutually Assured Destruction,</p>
  <p>we watched the Ozone Hole emerge out of greed and lack of wisdom.</p>
  <p>we are witnessing species disappearing every day,</p>
  <p>lack of understanding of climate change,</p>
  <p>and basics of disease prevention.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>This is happening <em>not</em> because people are evil,</p>
  <p>but because they never received a meaningful education, never read enough books to break out and become inspired.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Many people do notice this,</p>
  <p>and do take to videos, audio books and lectures,</p>
  <p>and they do become moved.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>They learn, and grasp a deeper nature of the thinking mistakes they made,</p>
  <p>from simple topics like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_raw_milk_debate">Raw Milk</a> consumption, and the pseudo-scientific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathy">Homeopathy</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiropractic">Chiropractic Treatments</a>,</p>
  <p>to dangers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_hesitancy">Vaccine Hesitancy</a> and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_topics_characterized_as_pseudoscience">Pseudoscienific Garbage</a> they are able to become more realistic about other things.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But this is difficult, it is not as common as it should be,</p>
  <p>and what an awful injustice it is to deny these basic facts of living.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>This is the challenge we must overcome,</p>
  <p>we tried organized education and with grades and incompetent teachers we witnessed generations of children being pushed into Poverty of Mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Grades, what a tragic idea,</p>
  <p>and how easily will children convince themselves that they are not enough; not good enough.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>How many teachers tried to tell their students that they are bad at learning,</p>
  <p>and how many children became convinced of that, that they are not smart?</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Where truth is, that we are all equally capable,</p>
  <p>all capable of genius so as long as it is real kind and not the &quot;I am better than you kind&quot; like photographic memory</p>
  <p>(which is fake, no one ever had it; people just said they did to look smart).</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>World&apos;s politicians are facing these flaws as well,</p>
  <p>they can&apos;t tell if Homeopathy is real or not, not without a real education.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Today, there is nothing that can be done about people in authority lacking in education,</p>
  <p>the only thing that can stop them is time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And it is our job now,</p>
  <p>that the new generation of Policy Makes does not suffer from inability to tell real from fantasy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>In the absence of teachers,</p>
  <p>we become the teachers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I challenge you my Dear Readers,</p>
  <p>to books, to becoming a teacher, and a Great Being,</p>
  <p>helping the world grow in health.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We have to help children understand that a life of fantasy,</p>
  <p>is not a complete life, that it is our right to live in realty.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Our generation, must be the generation of the Well Read, of The Wise, of The Teachers,</p>
  <p>with a clear vision of the future; we are not to fight, we are to learn and teach.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The children will grow up into a world where corruption of today,</p>
  <p>has passed of old age, of its own toxic sickness.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The children must learn to be teachers as well,</p>
  <p>bu they face even a greater task, the task of becoming Incorruptible Leaders.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The leaders the world hopes to see today,</p>
  <p>those are the children that look up to us for guidance.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We must rise today.</p>
  <p>Rise against lies and liars, manipulators and cheaters, leeches and big fat white lice,</p>
  <p>we must rise against poverty, against fake education and the grades that connive children they are not enough.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We must rise, against every ongoing mistake,</p>
  <p>every invisible wall,</p>
  <p>and stand our ground.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Knowing that our world is the world of reality,</p>
  <p>and that is the only world worthy of us.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>With all our might, we are not to fight,</p>
  <p>we are to live our lives and finally reach happiness,</p>
  <p>but on our way there we are to learn, become wise, become teachers, and aim to become great beings.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Not only for our own dignity and to honor those we love,</p>
  <p>but also for all the future yet to come.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>May all the future generation read our works,</p>
  <p>and determine that this year, was the first year of the new era they they hold so dearly.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>That this year, was the year that future thinkers marked,</p>
  <p>as The Day Humanity Entered Into The Age Of Wisdom.</p>
