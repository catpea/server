  <p>You must not allow your parents to use school as a babysitter,</p>
  <p>you must not allow your teachers to trick you into memorization.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Friends and social life, are not an excuse to stay in a bad school,</p>
  <p>grab your friends and transfer to something better, or learn on your own.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>A bad school diploma does not get you anything,</p>
  <p>it only shows people that they can cheat you.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <hr>
</section>

<section>
  <p>On the other hand dumping a broken school,</p>
  <p>and transferring to something that does show results makes a world of difference.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>For one it will help you experience independence,</p>
  <p>with a small measure of discomfort it will help your mind become stronger.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>You do not want to work at a company that expect you to waste years on junk lectures,</p>
  <p>your years are precious, each year must find you smarter, stronger, and wiser.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Rejection of pretending to learn,</p>
  <p>and not following others will help you grow.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Finding lectures or books that do make you smarter and wiser,</p>
  <p>will help you build your own company.</p>
</section>

<section>

</section>


<section>
  <p>Schools are almost certainly completely broken,</p>
  <p>they may be so broken that otherwise normal people may need dangerous medications to pass.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>You must resist memorization, and merely getting good at passing tests,</p>
  <p>because that is not an real education, that&apos;s just basic acting.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>It is not enough to be in school,</p>
  <p>or even to have good grades.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>You must ask yourself if you are learning for real,</p>
  <p>and if what you are learning is useful to you.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>You must ask yourself if you are seeing real results,</p>
  <p>if what you have learned had a positive impact on you.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <hr>
</section>

<section>
  <p>And, you may not be able to find a school,</p>
  <p>it is a real tragedy, we failed you.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Even if &quot;Fake it until you make it&quot;,</p>
  <p>has already turned the world into a brittle cheeto.</p>
</section>

</section>

<section>
  <p>There is hope,</p>
  <p>the hope is in self-education.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>The people who invented schools and those who made breakthroughs in science,</p>
  <p>begun their self education with a single thread or a question.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>They followed a single unbroken line of curiosities and answers,</p>
  <p>start with survey courses in Science and Adventure.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>To find your beginning search carefully amongst electronics,</p>
  <p>art and sculpture or painting and music, computers, design, programming.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Find the start, get your answers, and rest,</p>
  <p>and now resume from where you left off.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>No stress here,</p>
  <p>no hard work.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>You may only need LEGO Technic and a Raspberry PI kit with sensors,</p>
  <p>maybe a a book about UNIX and a couple of used cheap 3D printers that you splice together.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>The only thing that you have to be mindful of,</p>
  <p>is keeping a a small Research Journal and Building a Huge Colorful Portfolio.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>In fact your portfolio should become one of the main reasons,</p>
  <p>for becoming a Graphic Designer and possibly a Web Developer.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>After all, you are capturing your pure joy,</p>
  <p>and your path of self-education is pure pride.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <hr>
</section>

<section>
  <p>This kind of coupling, where the want of a beautiful portfolio,</p>
  <p>pushes you towards Design, and possibly programming happens often.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>A personal &quot;want&quot; has driven many independent inventors before you,</p>
  <p>difference between being taught, and reaching out for knowledge yourself is like night and day.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>One takes you to enlightenment, and the other,</p>
  <p>often times towards hating Mondays, waiting for Wednesdays and drinking on Fridays while you wonder if you hate your life.</p>
</section>

</section>

<section>
  <p>It is likely that you will not be accepted to Harvard, not even Peace Corps,</p>
  <p>but listen...</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>...what does an institution that expects you to sit through worthless mind numbing lectures,</p>
  <p>matter to you, and what does that say about their values and ideals, and deans and the friends and experiences you will encounter there.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Don&apos;t bother with things that are not worth your time,</p>
  <p>we have to find a way to fix the world.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>We have to fix schools, we have to fix poverty,</p>
  <p>and damn it, we can&apos;t go through our lives with atomic weapons pointed at our families.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Ideas like Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD),</p>
  <p>and banning certain weapons in war but not war it self really show us how young of a civilization we are.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Now we race for a High School or College Diploma,</p>
  <p>by pretending to learn with memorization while teachers pretend they didn&apos;t force us into it for a paycheck.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>And deans pretend they have no idea this is going on,</p>
  <p>and for the mere stress of massive unforgivable student debt we can get a brand name education that recruiters will void their bowels over.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Oh, and not to mention the 13th Amendment where we can be sent into Legal Slavery,</p>
  <p>by downloading the complete questionable works of Lady Gaga in mp3 format, or even just for participating in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System">IPFS</a> to host our own poems.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <hr>
</section>

<section>
  <p>There is nothing that you will gain from not learning,</p>
  <p>pretending to get educated is just the same as staying uneducated.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Spewing useless gibberish about Trig or powerhouses of the cell,</p>
  <p>only makes people look foolish.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Not only that, but eventually they figure out they got tricked into cramming,</p>
  <p>and now not only the look foolish - but heartbreakingly - start feeling it too.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>For those of you who did get tricked,</p>
  <p>please just listen to top rated Audio Books in the science, adventure, philosophy and memoir section, it won&apos;t take long to catch up.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>That whole thing about not being able to learn fast because you are older is fake,</p>
  <p>as you get older your bullshit meters get better.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>It is just that you are no longer willing to waste your time on useless things,</p>
  <p>that&apos;s why books work but re-taking the GED does not.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <hr>
</section>

<section>
  <p>But do take it easy,</p>
  <p>especially when you are young.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Learn to avoid troublemakers,</p>
  <p>they are just children with aged faces.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>And no there are no exceptions,</p>
  <p>and no you are not meant to fill in the blanks for them.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>The last thing you need is your husband deciding to smoke weed or become a drunk (or worse) 15 years into a marriage because it is now legal,</p>
  <p>there is no excuse, no shortcuts in the world of lack of education, we neeeeeeeed wisdom, it is our operating system, it is our everything.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Our minds are so powerful,</p>
  <p>it is so easy to inherit from memoirs.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>When combining fascinating books with incredible adventures...</p>
  <p>when you find your self atop of an ancient dune in the middle of a nasty storm listening to a life changing book, it all becomes clear.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>You are underestimating yourself,</p>
  <p>most of us have no idea how powerful we are.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Our only problem is that in the face of not knowing,</p>
  <p>we can be easily mislead and follow useless paths for years or even decades, such as is the case with ineffective education.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>So speak out,</p>
  <p>don&apos;t follow, and don&apos;t be silent.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>With the aid of your classroom friends,</p>
  <p>make it clear to your teacher that you would rather study things that are relevant to you-personally, that enlighten your path and produce lasting results that you can build on.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Read books, begin your self education, and develop the skills necessary to express your concerns about the school just turning you into profits,</p>
  <p>fill an auditorium, give speeches and talks in multiple schools; become a leader, an inspiration, a Great Being.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Do Not Follow,</p>
  <p>Life Is Too Precious, and Your Wisdom Too Important.</p>
