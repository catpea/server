  <p>All that has ever gone wrong,</p>
  <p>has gone wrong due to rejecting realities, and accepting, fantasies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>To deny truth, is to create a terrible fantasy,</p>
  <p>and no human being should ever be committed to one - as life is far too precious.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Yes, fantasies in a sickly way are more comfortable,</p>
  <p>than the authentic life that unfolds by rules independent from our wishes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But rejecting pleasant fantasies is no different</p>
  <p>than the rejection of drugs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is simply not who we are,</p>
  <p>and not where healthy people wish to be, or can possibly grow.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is not that the world is too difficult to grasp,</p>
  <p>but that, too many people are suffering from lack of knowledge.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Knowledge is found in books, best experience in their audio form,</p>
  <p>and on a pleasant and relaxing adventure.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Books whose authors are admired for their hard work, clarity of long therm vision,</p>
  <p>intelligence, wisdom, and often a wonderful sense of humor.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Alas, far too many people take to relive their fears by,</p>
  <p>by constructing a view of the world they can understand and control.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>All fantasies will eventually call for reinforcement,</p>
  <p>and as history shows, at any, and all cost.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Be it something as tiny as the number of likes on a social network,</p>
  <p>as odd as the status that pointlessly-expensive-cars bring.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Or something as heartbreaking as political systems,</p>
  <p>where fathers will easily send their children to kill each other in battle fields.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A fantasy will call for reinforcement,</p>
  <p>to keep it going to make it last, and no price will ever be too big.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Reality, is much harsher and not as comfortable or easy to grasp,</p>
  <p>will call for constant effort, hard earned foresight, real and lasting results to our endeavors, and authentic dignity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>In reality; color of skin, numbered of colored pieces of paper, or the colors of a flag,</p>
  <p>do not define who is superior, and who is inferior, who is better and who is worse.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>In fantasy, poverty and war, are facts of life,</p>
  <p>in reality, Love, Health, and World Peace, are, the most beautiful rewards for the most difficult of achievements.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>In fantasy we crated tens of thousands of gods and as many battles in their worship,</p>
  <p>in reality we invent Flight, try to get to the Moon for no clear reason, and even fantasize about Interstellar Travel to cross the galaxy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>In reality there is no evil, just a steady and colorful progress forward, we build Nuclear Plants and not Nuclear Missiles,</p>
  <p>in fantasy evil oozes from the cracks that mad men must keep patching to prevent their small minds from falling to a thousand pieces.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Fantasies spread with culture,</p>
  <p>they quite imperceptibly trick us into thinking of ourselves as other than we really are.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>For example, if you don&apos;t believe you can be a genius,</p>
  <p>you will not be able to become one, you&apos;ll never aim for it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The longer you delay, the more obstacles will arise in your path</p>
  <p>if you don&apos;t believe you can cross that challenge, you won&apos;t even try.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>If you grant others control over your time, or life,</p>
  <p>you will only limit yourself and how far you can travel.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Your mind is powerful enough to host cities of thoughts and dreams of, any size,</p>
  <p>the only limit to your intelligence is the ability to mistakenly stop your self by accepting some falsehood.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Love, genius, empathy, foresight and insight, and spirituality exist within us all,</p>
  <p>but without knowledge and eventual wisdom they too are limited and fall short.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Yes, at first, the real world is unknown to us,</p>
  <p>but it is not meant to frighten us into creating fantasies that we think we can grasp.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It simply requires that we listen to a hundred books,</p>
  <p>take a moment to explore the world around us with our new found experience...</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And then very slowly and very gently as our long lives unfold,</p>
  <p>listen to, and read, just about nine hundred more as not to ever fall short, and always have a beautiful story to tell.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We are sure to become wise, with all the building blocks we gain from books,</p>
  <p>and then, if should we wish, we can turn right around and create some new books for others to read, and grow up with.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Do not be scared my friends,</p>
  <p>as scary as poverty is, its power flows precisely from lack of education, wisdom and above all foresight.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The more knowledgeable and wiser the world,</p>
  <p>the more overwhelming the force to crush poverty.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Growing up to become knowledgeable and wise as opposed to merely age in some easy fantasy,</p>
  <p>is critical for our mental health and well being.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A thousand books you can listen to while traveling worlds most beautiful hiking trails,</p>
  <p>is hardly a challenge, it shouldn&apos;t even be seen as a inconvenience.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Inheriting real and functional knowledge, that has a powerful and lasting impact on our growing up,</p>
  <p>that enriches and enhances our decision making bringing us clear visions and impossible dreams is a great reward.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Becoming broke, or homeless, never being able to get a job, and being seen as a waste of life,</p>
  <p>is not something that can happen to a wise a beautiful person that rejects fantasies in search of truths.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And it is important to remember,</p>
  <p>that we can&apos;t graduate a by cramming and temporary memorizing disconnected facts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A fake education,</p>
  <p>is a meaningless education.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Companies known for hiring such inauthentic individuals are full of life draining liars and pretenders and probably in high positions,</p>
  <p>whatever they build cannot be built with vision and wisdom, it can only self destruct.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Once you become self educated,</p>
  <p>you are granted the opportunity to build your own companies with foresight and invention.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>My dear reader, I would bet building an open and grade-free school that actually educates its students will be high up on your to-do list.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Building companies only becomes stressful when you build them for their own sake due to lack of vision,</p>
  <p>when you enter on the path towards wisdom, you won&apos;t merely aim to impress investors, you will move generations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is OK to blindly set off towards wisdom,</p>
  <p>it is one of the few leaps of faith that are worth the while.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Whatever your aims, may you inspire countless dreamers to greatness,</p>
  <p>and may you reject all fantasy, holding authenticity and wisdom as the highest of values.</p>
