  <p>To learn something you must hunger for it,</p>
  <p>to learn something, you must love it.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>To learn something, you must enjoy it so much, that you will put it aside,</p>
  <p>and learn the stuff beneath it first, to grant yourself a fair chance at mastery.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <hr>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Every little bit counts,</p>
  <p>but only if it comes in a sequence that fits what you have already learned.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>If you attempt to learn things out of sequence,</p>
  <p>or worse yet, trust someone to teach you,</p>
  <p>it won&apos;t work, it never has, it never will, forget it.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>And it is not just sequence,</p>
  <p>it is also the speed at which you learn, that must be taken under consideration.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <hr>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Sequence and Pace,</p>
  <p>now that is just the barbarian level of learning, meant for warriors.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>You, can do better than that,</p>
  <p>you certainly should.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>When you learn is important,</p>
  <p>night owls will learn at a different time of day than others.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>It is the environment that matters,</p>
  <p>some people can&apos;t learn in a city and will needs trees and mountains.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>And, the geographic location matters too, if you love numbers, and calculus calls to you,</p>
  <p>visit Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz at Neust&#xE4;dter Kirche in Hanover Germany,</p>
  <p>visit Sir Isaac Newton at Westminster Abbey in London, England.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>And remember, Sciences are learned not by memorizing facts,</p>
  <p>but by tracing their development across the ages.</p>
</section>

<section>

</section>

<section>
  <p>Schools are here to teach us,</p>
  <p>but they don&apos;t know how.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>What they do know,</p>
  <p>is how to fake it,</p>
  <p>and make it appear like you are learning.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>The motive is simple,</p>
  <p>for as long as the school gets funding,</p>
  <p>everyone gets to keep their job.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Yes,</p>
  <p>it is fraud.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Yes, they are selling your mind for a small paycheck,</p>
  <p>the curriculum is impossible to learn from.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Curriculum is stitched out of questions that you will have to pass later on,</p>
  <p>so that the school can continue to operate, they just want you to retain most of it,</p>
  <p>and they will expect you to cram before that test too.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <hr>
</section>

<section>
  <p>If you want to become a Doctor, Scientist, Mathematician,</p>
  <p>you need to be going to a real school, that will encourage you to learn in optimal ways,</p>
  <p>a public school is not the optimal setting for education.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <hr>
</section>

<section>
  <p>A public school is primary for babysitting,</p>
  <p>so that you&apos;re not home alone trying to set your or the sticky bandits hair on fire.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>In order for that school to exist,</p>
  <p>teachers need to get paid,</p>
  <p>so you need to pretend to learn by just memorizing,</p>
  <p>and passing tests, your grades help the school continue to operate.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Nobody cares if you are learning,</p>
  <p>or memorizing.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>To graduate with a good GPA, you will have to memorize,</p>
  <p>and it will be disconnected facts, they will be out of sequence,</p>
  <p>they cannot possibly fit what you already know, and you will forget it all.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>In return for hoop jumping you will get a diploma,</p>
  <p>and will be accepted to college or university if you cram for the SAT and entrance exams.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>In college, your education will be slowed down,</p>
  <p>it will be called, balanced education, and they will say it with a straight face like a cult member.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>The text books will be $300, lectures $500,</p>
  <p>and you can apply for Medical School from here, and move on.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <hr>
</section>

<section>
  <p>It is hinted that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Papers">Panama Papers</a> are a good example of what is going on,</p>
  <p>there is no central organization that encourages corruption,</p>
  <p>it is just that everyone is looking for a shortcut.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <hr>
</section>

<section>
  <p>You can stand up in class,</p>
  <p>but everyone jobs are at stake.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>You will be accused of disrupting the class,</p>
  <p>and you will be suspended.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>They will stress you out,</p>
  <p>they will make you tired,</p>
  <p>they will make you drop out.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <hr>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Let me just say,</p>
  <p>that you are not allowed to stand by when someone is getting hurt.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>If the teacher or security are acting creepy,</p>
  <p>talk to the principal, explain that the second time it happens, you will call the police.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>The teachers, in their haste will give up on the students in the back,</p>
  <p>they have fallen behind on material, but now they are being made to feel that they are unintelligent,</p>
  <p>this will destroy their minds, this will cause great harm to their self esteem,</p>
  <p>they need your help, get them audio books, Bill Bryson and Carl Sagan.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <hr>
</section>

<section>
  <p>I think most teachers, when pressured,</p>
  <p>will tell you that you are expected to learn on your own,</p>
  <p>and in effect confess, that they are useless, when it comes to teaching you for real.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>That the classroom is about standardized testing,</p>
  <p>for which it is easier to force you to memorize disconnected bits of knowledge that you will soon forget,</p>
  <p>then to actually craft a curriculum that will fit all the students,</p>
  <p>and match their existing knowledge,</p>
  <p>and the natural pace at which they learn,</p>
  <p>and their personality.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <hr>
</section>

<section>
  <p>It used to be true that a single teacher cannot approach all their students in a way that will help them learn,</p>
  <p>so to stay in business, they would force them into memorization.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>But today, that is not the case. Today, the only reason why the old ways are still in place,</p>
  <p>is because low quality schools are continuing to try to stay in business - this is evil.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Today, with the help of computers, smart phones and tablets,</p>
  <p>interactive/open curricula, online lectures, Audio Books, and internet,</p>
  <p>it is possible to approach each student individually,</p>
  <p>I am sure there are online schools that are trying to do just that.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>There is no excuse for why anybody should have less than an A, or a 4.0 GPA,</p>
  <p>that is what being in school is about, learning, and when you have learned, you get an A.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <hr>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Even now, I can&apos;t see everything that has gone wrong,</p>
  <p>schools have become a bit less unforgiving, I am sure.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>But even so, the fact remains,</p>
  <p>today schools can&apos;t teach.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>They are wicked good,</p>
  <p>at tricking students into thinking that they are not smart enough for good grades.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>At the end of the day,</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGoZZvfEd6A">you will still need an education</a>.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Your only safe bet,</p>
  <p>is becoming self taught,</p>
  <p>independent study.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>And please, don&apos;t let anybody call you a Genius,</p>
  <p>help others, help them find knowledge too.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Finally,</p>
  <p>I describe this tragedy to the best of my abilities,</p>
  <p>on a tired mind, some things have slipped, others are out of shape, please forgive me.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>But, I do know one thing for certain,</p>
  <p>this is not a standing tragedy that will remain forever.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>This is a call for heroism,</p>
  <p>for courage, and courage calls to courage everywhere.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>This is how Life asks for help,</p>
  <p>you are now being challenged to stand up to mediocrity, to lies.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Become a Great Being,</p>
  <p>Fix Schools.</p>
