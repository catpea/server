  <p>At first they laughed, then they called them a cult,</p>
  <p>then accused them of corruption, and when it was all over,</p>
  <p>most called them The Founding Mothers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We didn&apos;t live under a threat of Nuclear War,</p>
  <p>the models predicted the war as 100% certain.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>This is what happens, when one generation passes onto the next,</p>
  <p>Mutually Assured Destruction.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It didn&apos;t take computer models,</p>
  <p>it didn&apos;t require an imagination,</p>
  <p>war only needs time, guns and borders.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>For uneducated humans, war is a certainty,</p>
  <p>war is where we all come from.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The models predicted that it would take decades,</p>
  <p>nearly a century to reach a stable disarmament.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>One of the greatest problems that Humanity faces is born of group cohesion,</p>
  <p>when we lived in tribes automatic self-indoctrination ensured tribe stability.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>When the world connected,</p>
  <p>accepting the cultures and beliefs of the local group we were born into, divided us from the rest creating a border.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The threat of nuclear war grew, and it was not disarmament,</p>
  <p>but leaving all the bad ideas behind, that would make all the difference.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Abandoning invisible indoctrination and leaving imperceptibly-bad ideas behind,</p>
  <p>can only occur on generation by generation level.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The generations with cultures holding bad ideas needed to retire out of old age,</p>
  <p>and a more realistic, more educated, wiser and humane culture, was to take over.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>No abrupt changes could be made without conflict,</p>
  <p>out of love for all Life and Humanity this was the first project to require over a hundred years of work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And so sweetly, one of the girls said, that this would require the work of a League,</p>
  <p>The League of Extraordinary Ladies, another one jokingly proclaimed in a grumbly tone.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And the Universe,</p>
  <p>did smile.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The models revealed that Political Borders and Nationalism in a Nation armed with Nuclear Weapons,</p>
  <p>would result in a high probability of a Nuclear War, as each generation is indoctrinated into the worst ideas of the previous.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The most terrifying model prediction was that as more and more got lost in translation between consecutive generations,</p>
  <p>the probability of nuclear war approached 100%.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And as all Heroines do, The League of Extraordinary Ladies,</p>
  <p>set off on a multi-generational promise, to save the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The weakness, of the ease with which we accept the culture we are born into as true and perfect,</p>
  <p>was going to be addressed by a novel educational program creatively named the Global Progressive Advancement (GPA).</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Volunteers would create free, open, unbranded, library of audio books out of works in public domain,</p>
  <p>and the website would stitch these works together into Audio Lectures with the aid of speakers, poets and teachers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Celebrities, well known authors, and even movie stars would contribute their time, voice and patience,</p>
  <p>to create what became the greatest work of art, that by far exceeded even the most romantic descriptions of the Library of Alexandria.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A number of authors donated their works to the school,</p>
  <p>students participating in the free self-paced open-curriculum school had access to Carl Sagan, Bill Bryson, Neil deGrasse Tyson, and pretty much all the others.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>By 2050, it was the only school taken seriously,</p>
  <p>because it was the only school that resulted in students showing great results.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The school brought the world together in Knowledge and Wisdom,</p>
  <p>and as predicted in less than a 150 years from the initial inception, the borders fell.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A new, and more informed, nuclear disarmament program was born,</p>
  <p>that decades after resulted in cessation of weapons manufacturing of all kind throughout Europe and Asia.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>These seemingly fantastic, impossible goals of world peace,</p>
  <p>were achieved by helping Humanity converge on wisdom by means of books made more accessible by narrators.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Providing superior education to the children of a nation,</p>
  <p>whilst letting their parents live out culture they were born into,</p>
  <p>is a form of Infinite Kindness, it is a form of Love.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Rather than the children inheriting just the culture of their parents and the nation they were born to,</p>
  <p>by participating in the Global Progressive Advancement program, they also inherited the best ideas and wisdom from Humanity&apos;s most beloved books.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>World Peace was reached by taking advantage of our susceptibility to cultural indoctrination,</p>
  <p>to blindly and without a question accepting ideas of the world we are born into,</p>
  <p>this was not a trick, but much needed medicine and vaccine that prevented mutually assured destruction.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We simply added Knowledge and Wisdom,</p>
  <p>to the culture and spirit of times, to all the nations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The first and foremost force of the educational program was not knowledge,</p>
  <p>it was Reality, something that corruption and decay is incapable of using for its advantage.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The reality of the human condition is that we all yearn for wisdom,</p>
  <p>and meaning, and love, and kinship and belonging.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It mattered not if it was two boys that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipR0kWt1Fkc">Father Gregory Boyle</a> was raising,</p>
  <p>or two nations that hated each other in starvation for wisdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Once they had access to wisdom,</p>
  <p>reality helped to unravel their misunderstandings and helped them grow.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The League of Extraordinary Ladies didn&apos;t stop at Nuclear Disarmament,</p>
  <p>their granddaughters ended poverty.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>They did so by, now the age old tradition of using weakness to fight weakness,</p>
  <p>they ended poverty by means of poverty.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It was a micro management, and micro payment transaction platform,</p>
  <p>distributed on smart tablets that helped communities of the world trade services.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The adoption of the platform was hastened by the fact that no money was made from these transactions by the hosting company,</p>
  <p>if someone needed a car ride, or grocery delivery, housework, or a tutor to help their kids with math, there was always someone ten minutes away that would help.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>One of the untended features of this program was local pantry,</p>
  <p>a feature originally intended for trading foodstuffs, that later became a place to feed the hungry.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The trading platform also helped to place the homeless in unused hotels and apartments,</p>
  <p>in such a way that they had easy access to care takers, teachers, therapists and a chance at a better future.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is hard to say what prevented Humanity as a whole from coming together like these friends did,</p>
  <p>but it is easy to see that it was internet that helped communities collaborate and communicate better.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We needed programs to help us talk to each other,</p>
  <p>and cut out the middle men.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We needed programs that helped cities become more independent,</p>
  <p>and stop relying on the state and nation that by contrast meant little.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And we needed to begin thinking in decades,</p>
  <p>in centuries.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Because our problems, do not end with us,</p>
  <p>and what we leave behind is easily misunderstood.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>What was originally created as a deterrent, come future, in chaos, in poverty, in haste,</p>
  <p>given all that is lost in translation, will eventually become the tool that it really is.</p>
