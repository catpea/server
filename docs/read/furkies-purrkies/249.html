  <p>Fake schooling and the resulting lack of education,</p>
  <p>not only hold us back and propagate misery but will destabilize a nation.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>But the problems are far more complicated,</p>
  <p>for one there are very few real criminals, most were just warped by lack of school.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Real schools, have the ability,</p>
  <p>to prevent a person from committing a crime.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>On top of that, upon committing a crime,</p>
  <p>if prisons were turned to special need schools, we could help almost everyone.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <hr>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Real schools are not that complex,</p>
  <p>plus they can use poverty to their advantage.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>By presenting students with a way out of poverty that fits them,</p>
  <p>the students will be put in a position where they will want to learn particular things.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>That&apos;s how real education works,</p>
  <p>it is not about tests an memorization, but need, imagination, triumph and challenge.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <hr>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Be it a misguided voter, a desperate student, or someone blinded by fear and anger and poverty,</p>
  <p>schools are all there really is, it is the greatest hope and dream.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>What we call a school today, is not a school,</p>
  <p>it is a collective fantasy that hands the teachers a paycheck, and the students a diploma.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Our cognitive biases make it so that we go along with it,</p>
  <p>there are people out there who hold up a diploma they crammed for and truly believe they are an engineer.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>This is probably similar to when a person commits a crime,</p>
  <p>they say &quot;This is is this is where I finally become free&quot;, but that is only cartoon reality.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>A college diploma does not mean that the student is educated,</p>
  <p>and when deans are pressed they will say, &quot;We discouraged cramming&quot;.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>And when everyone is pressed to own up,</p>
  <p>the mother of the boy who stole,</p>
  <p>the engineer&apos;s professor,</p>
  <p>and the engineer and the student,</p>
  <p>and that so called criminal,</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>the men who approve textbooks,</p>
  <p>those who pray to fairy-tales in hopes of saving nations they mistakenly destroyed,</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>and the prime ministers, and royalty,</p>
  <p>popes and cardinals,</p>
  <p>and the congresses, and the president,</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>and the men who nearly destroyed this nation by the practice of &quot;enhanced interrogation&quot;,</p>
  <p>and those who ignored climate change and might have done a lot worse than torture,</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>and those who are glad, that we all forgot,</p>
  <p>that we have all pointed intercontinental ballistic missiles at each other,</p>
  <p>all the major cities, all of them, every family, every future.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>All they will say is this:</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>&quot;I was JUST following orders.&quot;</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>&quot;I JUST didn&apos;t know.&quot;</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>&quot;HOW was I supposed to know?&quot;</p>
</section>

<section>
  <hr>
</section>

<section>
  <p>This is what fake education results in,</p>
  <p>this is the &quot;fake it until you make it&quot; pattern of behavior.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <hr>
</section>

<section>
  <p>The solution to it all is books,</p>
  <p>books that those of us who are good at narration,</p>
  <p>read for others who aren&apos;t very good at reading.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Teams of students, ganging up together to record books, with laughter, and foolishness,</p>
  <p>and dammit, sometimes adding whole new chunks to them, to make the dry parts more interesting.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>And sharing, with everyone,</p>
  <p>everywhere.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Laughter is the ultimate seal of authenticity,</p>
  <p>that something is worth our time.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Once the world awakens to the realization that students should make the lectures,</p>
  <p>driving them with collective curiosities and inspirations, and sharing them for free.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Kids will want to watch them,</p>
  <p>they will want to see what happens next.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Can you imagine a set of lectures by students working to bring back Pixel Art Games,</p>
  <p>lectures on the subject of Color Theory, Trigonometry, Calculus, Music Composition, and even woodworking for the arcade cabinets.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Can you see what having that full vision do to a young mind,</p>
  <p>how inspiring it is to see the classroom succeed in turning out, one game after another, and making a pretty penny too.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Real schools combine with reality,</p>
  <p>they are both an introduction to the real world and a future extension of it.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <hr>
</section>

<section>
  <p>I know that all of this is a lot to take in,</p>
  <p>it is a description of the biggest of our problems,</p>
  <p>and the middle of our solutions.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>The beginning is much simpler than that,</p>
  <p>the beginning starts off like every superhero origin story ever told.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>You build up your power,</p>
  <p>you armor.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>You pick up your first book, your second book, your third book,</p>
  <p>Metamorphosis, Walden, Cosmos, Into The Wild.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Sagan, Bryson, Thoreau, Kafaka, Krakauer, Kant, Nietzche,</p>
  <p>Dawkins, Harris, Hitchens, Dennett, and countelss others.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>With each book you hear, you inherit you inherit the wisdom of the author,</p>
  <p>just like that, straight up data transfer,</p>
  <p>and re-listening to the same audio books or lectures makes them even more powerful.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>It takes a few years to take it all on,</p>
  <p>but before you know it, your own idea synthesis kicks in.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <hr>
</section>

<section>
  <p>You&apos;ll be able to feel the world,</p>
  <p>and feel the fear of the fakers, and pretenders.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>You&apos;ll be able to see the paths of change,</p>
  <p>that the world needs so that it may continue growing.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>You&apos;ll be able to connect, restore, repair, and resume,</p>
  <p>the thoughts of all great beings from across all the ages.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Your intelligence is not set in stone, it is flexible,</p>
  <p>your mind is there to help you become more and more intelligent.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>The more you know, the faster you learn more,</p>
  <p>and the wiser and more intelligent you become.</p>
