  <p>The first point of failure,</p>
  <p>and our first hope for repairs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Is focus on real education.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Schools are graduating students that they failed to educate,</p>
  <p>these children grow into confused adults, lost and looking for belonging.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Why is this tolerated?</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Let me ask you,</p>
  <p>what would happen if we asked all the College Graduates to re-take all their tests from high school on?</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Shouldn&apos;t people who graduated college easily show improvement to their GPA when re-taking all their tests?</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Shouldn&apos;t those who graduated, but can&apos;t pass their test,</p>
  <p>ask for a refund, or a lawsuit for having been tricked into an impression of education?</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is tolerance of these simple stupid problems,</p>
  <p>that leads to made up lives of fantasy and eventual blindness towards evil.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>If you can&apos;t pass all the college tests and get a higher GPA than that with which you graduated college,</p>
  <p>then you do not have a college education.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>If you can&apos;t pass all the high school tests and get a higher GPA than that with which you graduated high school with,</p>
  <p>then you do not have a high school education.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>If you can&apos;t pass all the middle school tests and get a higher GPA than the one you left middle school with,</p>
  <p>then you do not have a middle school education.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Not only that, but the way these schools teach and the knowledge they drive into you,</p>
  <p>may not be useful; you may not even have a useful education.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I think we can all agree here,</p>
  <p>that we have a problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>At the very least,</p>
  <p>if your child has bad grades, don&apos;t make them feel bad, or unintelligent.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You should move them to a different type of school,</p>
  <p>where teachers are interested in educated children rather than turning them into a paycheck.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>The reason why it does not occur to parents that schools are not working,</p>
  <p>is that they don&apos;t have experience with fake institutions, they take them for granted.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>They are indoctrinated into a culture where school is good,</p>
  <p>and being a worker is great, and it takes a particularly awful person not to achieve anything in life.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>So what are those achievements?</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>How is all that retesting going?</p>
</div>

  <p>The problem, as you can imagine, is much larger,</p>
  <p>tolerance of fake education is just the beginning.</p>

  <p>Above all,</p>
  <p>Humanity must grow.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>We are not allowed to tolerate Human Right Violations,</p>
  <p>all human beings are created equal.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>All must be granted equal opportunity to real education,</p>
  <p>in a world that sets them free from poverty, and helps their bodies stay healthy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Nations are not allowed to oppress their people,</p>
  <p>no one has that right.</p>
</div>

  <p>Nations have a great responsibility to help them to a Real Education,</p>
  <p>in ways that will ignite a life long adventure across all sciences.</p>

  <p>An opinion cannot stand against a fact,</p>
  <p>that is a sign of illness, a small disorder born from fake-education.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And our dignity is such, that we must help each other rise,</p>
  <p>we are not to tolerate anything that tricks people into believing in options over facts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Fake education has been behind every evil perpetrated on this planet,</p>
  <p>it is very much like a virus, it does two things really well, it spreads, and it reinfects.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Whatever beliefs are too hard to let go of,</p>
  <p>we only need to place them in history or fantasy books.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is wonderful to ponder Ice Giants and Greats Serpents,</p>
  <p>but only as a fairy tale, or part of our growing up, not as a fact of life.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Fake education, unravels us,</p>
  <p>it erases great strides made by great beings, and pulls the younger generations into dark ages.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The fantasies that bring us calm,</p>
  <p>unravel the minds of the younger generations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The reason we search for mere calm,</p>
  <p>is that we ourselves, have been tricked out of real education.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>All these confusing questions,</p>
  <p>are easily treated with made up fantasies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But that also serves to defeat the purpose,</p>
  <p>of having a Beautiful and Powerful Mind.</p>

  <p>Not a single Human Being is allowed tolerate</p>
  <p>Concentration Camps, Abuse, Child Abuse, Racism and Xenophobia, or Inequality, Hate, or Fake Education.</p>

  <p>Those of us who chose to relegate ourselves to a life of fantasy,</p>
  <p>must also leave the table of public discourse.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Those of us who trade with nations that employ torture,</p>
  <p>are not allowed to hold political positions, they simply can&apos;t, it is immoral to tolerate this.</p>

  <p>Anybody who is delays Humanity&apos;s Progress,</p>

  <p>Government wise, there are no great disagreements,</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>On the individual level,</p>
  <p>it is not that different.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>Stress and anger, and sadness yield to Love and Wisdom,</p>
  <p>even tragedy turns around a little bit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>With real education, we don&apos;t fall to pieces because something beautiful ended,</p>
  <p>but we celebrate that it existed in the first place.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>In wisdom, we seek a different class of things,</p>
  <p>Nobler Things that come about as a result of our sense of dignity and real education.</p>

  <p>What creates an educated government, a real government,</p>

  <p>Nobody goes home convinced they are a worker,</p>
  <p>or terrified of Human Resources, or or an uneducated &quot;Boss&quot;.</p>

  <p>There isn&apos;t anybody who will argue against free medical care,</p>
  <p>or universal income, or national debt, let it pile up.</p>

  <p>The greater the debt that nations of earth owe to the universe,</p>
  <p>the higher our level of compassion, empathy and development.</p>

  <p>Money is just a job tracking tool,</p>

  <p>Fake Education,</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>It is neutering our minds,</p>
  <p>it is turning us into workers.</p>

  <p>It makes us ask stupid questions,</p>

  <p>We can&apos;t have a world without real education,</p>
  <p>the dark ages will swallow us through the various tax exempt churches and imaginary gods.</p>

  <p>Write, Rhyme, Paint, Tag,</p>
  <p>find your way out of fake education and whatever else is pulling you away from wisdom.</p>

  <p>Hold up you path, and show them the results,</p>
