  <p>You are more than a student, or employee,</p>
  <p>you are more than what you have, and even more than your dreams.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But oh my gosh, it is so easy to forget how special we all are,</p>
  <p>fall to daily routines, and carrots and sticks and stones.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Two weeks of vacation for a little adventure is not enough</p>
  <p>to push stress back and remember how beautiful we all are.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We have to try very hard not to lose ourselves in work,</p>
  <p>in stress, in deceptions, in toxic situations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Listen, just because you CAN - if you go all out to get that promotion,</p>
  <p>or GPA, or diploma, it does not mean you should.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Because, you MUST make room for Sunshine, and Starry Nights,</p>
  <p>for little adventures allover the place, and then some.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Your well being is not to be sacrificed for any reason,</p>
  <p>no matter who is telling you that you must, must, must!</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>No, just say no,</p>
  <p>and go.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Go, on the worlds most perfect adventure,</p>
  <p>one that lasts a long time, and starts with a tiny shopping expedition,</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But also carries on for days, maybe weeks,</p>
  <p>a visit to every antique store along the way to buy the cheapest but cutest thing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>So cute, that NOBODY will question you needing it,</p>
  <p>but so CHEAP, that everyone will say &quot;Oh wow, it is already old!&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And then make expeditions to get ice cream,</p>
  <p>and sausages, and why not buy a White Chocolate Cookies And Creme candy bar, why not in deed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And continue on, mounting expeditions for fossils, and minerals,</p>
  <p>a lighthouse, a beach far and yonder, chipmunk photos, and firewood.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>All the while, remembering, and sometimes discovering,</p>
  <p>who you are, where you are headed in life, and what it will be like when you arrive.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I... like driving at night,</p>
  <p>because it seems safer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I pack my gear in the afternoon,</p>
  <p>I make sure to have water and some canned goods.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I wait until early Monday morning,</p>
  <p>2AM or so, connect my GPS and go.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It takes about 3.5 hours to get there,</p>
  <p>I always listen to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DKhc1pcDFM">The Four Horsemen Discussion</a> couple of times.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I discovered the Ludington State Park,</p>
  <p>by just following highways and big roads.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is really easy to get there,</p>
  <p>take I-275 North, and follow I-96 West they kind of connect with an arc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Then after hours and hours,</p>
  <p>then take exit 1B to merge onto US-31 North, that takes you to the city limits.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Then when you run out of road,</p>
  <p>take a left on US-10 that will take you in to Ludington.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Please drive carefully,</p>
  <p>try to bring many friends along.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I always arrive early,</p>
  <p>so I take a small nap in the Meijer parking lot.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Upon my awakening I go get some Ice Cream,</p>
  <p>and shop around for Fanny Packs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And, I always make sure to have mosquito sticks,</p>
  <p>the thick ones that you light on fire, watch for that ash if you try to move one.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You drive west through Ludington,</p>
  <p>there is a huge parking lot and a beach like no other.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Please ignore the signs that say &quot;DO NOT FEED SEAGULLS&quot;,</p>
  <p>they are starving and need all your breadcrumbs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I always watch sunsets, but when I parked at that beach, got ready, and put my sunglasses on,</p>
  <p>some cute couple started making fun of me for how seriously I take the whole ordeal.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Perhaps it is just better to keep slowly driving north,</p>
  <p>towards the State Park.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I always do, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/EkQ991wM6qqLk7et8">my office is there</a>, for one,</p>
  <p>right on that little parking lot when the dunes start, it is, a good view.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I remember one time I caught a nap there too,</p>
  <p>waking up to an endless horizon was quite an awakening, that for sure.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Well you know how it is, State Parks are not free,</p>
  <p>and it is best to book a Jack Pine Hike-in Site ahead of time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>As you keep going north, you can pay on the left where the campers go,</p>
  <p>or you can just keep going and pay by the gate.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Park, disembark, and get ready to haul everything to your hike-in site,</p>
  <p>watch out for owls.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Once you are there, set up camp, get some squeaky water out of the pump,</p>
  <p>and get all the firewood you can find.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I always bring a hand saw with me,</p>
  <p>I don&apos;t mess around when it comes to firewood.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And then hop over the dune,</p>
  <p>there is a paradise out there, and you have to build something out of the drift wood.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The little lighthouse in the distance,</p>
  <p>that&apos;s the Big Sable Point Lighthouse.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>They sometimes hire people to work in their gift-shop,</p>
  <p>and apparently give them a little apartment up there; sounds lonely to me.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Every time you come back from a little adventure,</p>
  <p>and see that &quot;JACK PINE CAMPGROUND HIKE-IN SITES&quot; sign, it will feel like coming back home.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Jack Pine is a wonderful place,</p>
  <p>aim to stay there a month if you can.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Move from site to site,</p>
  <p>stay a day at the State Park, shower and come back to Jack Pine until you had enough.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Finally, when it is time to leave Jack Pine,</p>
  <p>grab a pine cone to remember it by, and head to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/wwegDL9VawQ1GFn5A">Nordhouse</a>, just for a day or two.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>They have a metal box you slip a few dollars into to get a parking permit,</p>
  <p>and you&apos;ll have to hike a bit to get to the Wideness area, but it will be worth it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is so beautiful, that you may wish to stay longer than a couple of days,</p>
  <p>you can walk the woods via Arrowhead Trail, or take the beach.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Watch for breaks in the grass,</p>
  <p>that usually means there is a neat campsite out there.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Jack Pine will always feel very welcoming,</p>
  <p>Nordhouse is a bit wilder.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You will have sand in your gear, and car for months,</p>
  <p>hopefully to last you a whole winter so that you may get a refill come spring.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I say the Nordhouse sand brings good luck, and good memories,</p>
  <p>when you are stressed out in a hurry, and notice there is still some sand left...</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It will put things in perspective,</p>
  <p>take you back to your latest camping adventure for a moment, help you slow down.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And above all, remind you to tidy up your gear,</p>
  <p>give that old tent a sniff and see if you need to order a new one.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Before you know it,</p>
  <p>it will be ample time to head on out there again.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>One of the healthiest things we can do,</p>
  <p>is sync up with the sun... go to sleep at sundown and get up at sunrise.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Another is to always make sure,</p>
  <p>we have plenty of room in our life to read or listen to books.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And most importantly, Nature,</p>
  <p>the bird song,</p>
  <p>the chipmunk squeaks,</p>
  <p>the crisp air,</p>
  <p>the rich woodland fragrance of moss, fern and bear,</p>
  <p>the building of a fire,</p>
  <p>swimming in the lake,</p>
  <p>exploring ancient dunes,</p>
  <p>aimlessly collecting fossils and cute pebbles by the beach,</p>
  <p>watching a beautiful storm in the distance,</p>
  <p>searching for arrowheads...</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>...suddenly popping into the nearby gas-station to get more ice cream and sausage,</p>
  <p>and then getting back to the camp, for another long and starry evening,</p>
  <p>and slowly falling asleep, just to wake up to a another healing day.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Never forget your dreams,</p>
  <p>never forget who you are.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Never, overwork yourself,</p>
  <p>just because you can it does not mean you should.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We are far too beautiful to treat ourselves cogs in a machine,</p>
  <p>we are meant to grow, and bloom, and inspire, and move entire generations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We are so good at learning, and understanding, and mastering knowledge,</p>
  <p>that past a few books, the undiscovered country beacons.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We are a young civilization,</p>
  <p>do not let that push you around.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You are to discover your path to becoming a Great Being,</p>
  <p>and help the world grow in Wisdom and in Peace.</p>
