  <p>My Friends,</p>
  <p>No century is ordinary, and such is the case with this one,</p>
  <p>you have a little bit of work to do, you may need to slow down with school and work a bit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You will be creating a series of books about Real Education, Governing the World,</p>
  <p>Human Rights, and a beautiful Survey Course half-jokingly entitled, The Human Manual.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Today computers are everywhere, and they hold a powerful potential,</p>
  <p>one that can enhance Education, The Voter and Democracy,</p>
  <p>one that can simplify bureaucracies and Governments.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Humanity has been greatly enhanced by the experiment of mandatory education and free access to knowledge,</p>
  <p>but the systems of standardized education have fallen behind on times,</p>
  <p>we must now use computers to cater to individual students,</p>
  <p>and to remove the need of grades, replacing it with a simple history of self chosen subjects.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>This a great endeavor,</p>
  <p>for which few are ready.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>As it always happens in Human History,</p>
  <p>this challenge has been pressed upon our shoulders all too soon,</p>
  <p>it has been accelerated by Climate Change, Anthropocene Extinction, Mass Incarceration,</p>
  <p>and Needles Borders that uselessly Divide our Human Family.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>This century a Divided Humanity is a Weak Humanity,</p>
  <p>to face all the challenges and to ready the Younger Generations to carry on,</p>
  <p>we must unite, the Internet has been Ready for years now.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>What follows is an imperfect outline,</p>
  <p>of much needed works that aim to Strengthen Humanity,</p>
  <p>and help all the children with all the challenges they are soon to face.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<p>Book One: Real Education,</p>
<p>this is a choose your own adventure type experience, that is to be published as a Paper Book,</p>
<p>as an Audio Book, as a Video Book, and finally taught in schools as a series of lectures.</p>
<div class="section">
  <p>This is very important, My Friends, in 2020, at the time of writing this document,</p>
  <p>schools were unable to teach students, they would only force them into memorization,</p>
  <p>the motive was to receive state funding so that all school employees would get paid.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>(Much will be said on this subject, but much of it won&apos;t matter,</p>
  <p>because efficacy of education is _not_ judged by its collective test scores and trends,</p>
  <p>but rather; results. Its positive impact on the Voter, and City, State, and Nation Governments,</p>
  <p>and above all the well being of our Planet.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Book Two: Governing The World,</p>
  <p>is a book about establishing a Computer Program Managed Democracy,</p>
  <p>it is very much an augmented reality, a mirror of our world where our voices count for more.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The program harnesses the Wisdom of the Educated Humanity;</p>
  <p>for City, State, Nation, and Earth management.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is worth noting that it is to have its beginnings as a Interactive Fiction game,</p>
  <p>that is collaboratively expanded, much like the world encyclopedia.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Book Three: Human Rights,</p>
  <p>is a volume detailing stories about growing up in the world,</p>
  <p>it is just essays that highlight what people can do to help the World Grow,</p>
  <p>and how to go about it to become triumphant.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>This book speaks about a path to a United Humanity,</p>
  <p>it is not just about putting an end to the idea of borders as the European Union so nobly demonstrates,</p>
  <p>but it is about getting ready to commit all ideas that result in dividing us to history books,</p>
  <p>and accepting the fact that we are just one family, that we are the Wise Caretakers of Earth and all of Her Inhabitants.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Human Rights must also highlight the problem of inequality that leads to Incarceration,</p>
  <p>people are going to prisons due to lack of Education and Knowledge.</p>
  <p>Due to Stress, Poverty. Mental Disorders and Illness some of which is rooted in Neurological Disorders born from poverty, addiction, and unsafe environments.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Prisons must be replaced with Schools,</p>
  <p>Human beings do not belong in cages.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Furthermore,</p>
  <p>The first and foremost purpose of a Government is to end poverty, homelessness, hunger, and sickness to the best of our abilities.</p>
  <p>This means a Universal Basic Income, real money indistinguishable from a paycheck earned by hard work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>People who face Poverty, Hunger, Homelessness, treatable Illness,</p>
  <p>who feel isolated or excluded, will be unable to study and comprehend these great Works of Love that this text describes.</p>
  <p>We are One Family, we need their help, we need all of Humanity to permanently come together and leave bad ideas behind.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Book Four: The Human Manual,</p>
  <p>Is a Book of world&apos;s most inspirational and beloved essays.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It contains the following;</p>
  <p>cheerful chapters for Mighty Five Year Olds,</p>
  <p>inspiring essays for the Unstoppable Ten Year Olds,</p>
  <p>a loving introduction to the complexity of the world for Fifteen Year olds,</p>
  <p>and powerful and moving lessons for Teenagers and Twenty-somethings, lessons that many Thirty and Forty Year olds will lovingly return to.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>These works are not meant to be set in stone,</p>
  <p>the doors to new essays, submissions, and repairs, will always be open.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>They are to be translated into all the languages spoken today,</p>
  <p>in order to encourage global communication and unity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>These works, are works of the Universal Human Love,</p>
  <p>of Human Beings finally coming together to form a Single United Family.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>As a United Humanity,</p>
  <p>we can easily face all the challenges ahead.</p>
