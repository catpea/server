  <p>Universe created Evolution, Evolution created Consciousness,</p>
  <p>Consciousness created Humans, and Humans created Philosophy.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>The word Philosophy, comes from the greek Philosophia,</p>
  <p>it means Love of Wisdom.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>It comes from the time when Great Beings first begun emerging among us,</p>
  <p>they rejected inauthenticity, violence, contradiction, and imaginary things and creatures.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>These were the First Superheroes,</p>
  <p>they were often attacked.</p>
</section>

<section><img src="http://black:3000/read/furkies-purrkies/image/md-poetry-0079-socrates.jpg" alt="Socrates"></section>

<section>
  <p>This is Socrates, he taught the children power of Wisdom,</p>
  <p>he was sentenced to death, and he did not run, he died, for Wisdom.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Wisdom is self correcting,</p>
  <p>it eventually went against the State and its imaginary gods, and so the State went against him.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>He outlived the State by becoming immortal,</p>
  <p>he is often seen as the Father of Philosophy, but there were many other thinkers.</p>
</section>

<section><img src="http://black:3000/read/furkies-purrkies/image/md-poetry-0079-hepatia.jpg" alt="Hepatia"></section>

<section>
  <p>This is Hepatia, her tragedy, marks the end of the first Philosophers,</p>
  <p>the world plunged into Dark Ages.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>As hard earned as Wisdom is, as long as it takes to cultivate and grow,</p>
  <p>the criminals can take it away in a cold flash of steel.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Her tragedy, should not be forgotten, the Noblest become a target,</p>
  <p>to the fractured, and blind, and jealous.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>For now, Wisdom is no longer seen as the Highest there is,</p>
  <p>today, opinion seems to matter as much as fact.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>There are calls to &quot;teach controversy&quot;, for &quot;equal debate&quot;,</p>
  <p>to &quot;show both sides&quot;, to &quot;let the reader decide&quot;.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Falsely presenting a broken opinion,</p>
  <p>to be on par with the reality and fact that helps Humanity Grow.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>It is an old trick, it is cheap, and self assembling,</p>
  <p>it emerges on its own from poverty, inequality, suffering, blindness, and pain.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Being conscious and self aware, is not quite enough,</p>
  <p>because of Liars, Thieves, Criminals, Murderers, War, and even Poverty.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Wisdom is like a higher level Operating System for Humans,</p>
  <p>it enhances our consciousness, it grants us unique powers.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>But, Every Human, each member of the Grand Human Family,</p>
  <p>needs to see Wisdom as a necessity.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Until then, racism, xenophobia, inequality, poverty, and darkness,</p>
  <p>will keep us apart.</p>
</section>

<section><img src="http://black:3000/read/furkies-purrkies/image/md-poetry-0079-soldier.jpg" alt="Soldier"></section>

<section>
  <p>The Stories of Superheroes are rooted in lives of Philosophers,</p>
  <p>because a Philosopher cannot be hurt like the ordinary men.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Philosophers survive for thousands of years in text,</p>
  <p>in stories, in paintings.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>They survive by sharing Wisdom,</p>
  <p>that make us stronger, that enriches us, that we each yearn for.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>When you read the words of a philosopher,</p>
  <p>she or he comes round, and in a way they keep you company.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Socrates knew that,</p>
  <p>and he knew he needs to send a powerful message far into the future.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>An important being, died for something important,</p>
  <p>he is signaling, that Wisdom is Your Right.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>He was a Soldier,</p>
  <p>he found a way to repair the word.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>And it was,</p>
  <p>Love of Wisdom.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Once you begun paying attention to it all,</p>
  <p>a constellation of stars will begin assembling in you.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Each star will repair and strengthen all the others,</p>
  <p>it will bring you health and clarity.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Your contradictions will begin resolving,</p>
  <p>by rejecting and ejecting that which makes no sense.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>It will help your decision making,</p>
  <p>it won&apos;t let you move forward when two things oppose.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>It will keep you in place,</p>
  <p>until you reject the one that is not fact.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Where all the other stalks fracture,</p>
  <p>Wisdom will help you bend in the colder winds of change.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Foresight helps you combine knowledge,</p>
  <p>to construct events that are yet to unfold.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Moreover, it helps you construct the correct path ahead,</p>
  <p>and reject whatever else may come.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>The Power of Foresight does not end with the individual wielding it,</p>
  <p>it can extend to guiding the word to the correct its paths.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Heroism is in part is about learning what not to do,</p>
  <p>helping others requires solving their problems, and thus you learn life.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>But the greatest of insights are found in Memoirs worth reading,</p>
  <p>where they are placed in correct context.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>With enough insight Crime for example, transforms from an impenetrable state of mind that it is,</p>
  <p>to our need to create Walls of Prevention, so that people don&apos;t end up blind.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Punishment and Revenge is not a way to treat a Human Being fractured by poverty,</p>
  <p>or violence, or even hunger-for-food. Only prevention can work here.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>The power of insight shows you that while you can&apos;t go back in time,</p>
  <p>you can prevent the little ones from ending up in the same place.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>In that way, you take the pain of those Punished and use it for a thing that matters,</p>
  <p>preventing children from following in their footsteps.</p>
</section>

<section><img src="http://black:3000/read/furkies-purrkies/image/md-poetry-0079-martorano.jpg" alt="Martorano"></section>

<section>
  <p>And we get to feel others,</p>
  <p>we get to feel when they have been Wronged.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>And we get to feel what they felt, when times got tough,</p>
  <p>and the power of Compassion makes us a Family.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Who was it that gave [George Martorano][1] that little pencil,</p>
  <p>power of compassion is incredibly complex.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>You hold hands with every wronged being on Earth,</p>
  <p>those looking to their Favorite Star, wondering if someone else is looking there too.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>We are, we all are, we are there with you,</p>
  <p>You matter, your heart mattes, your mind matters, your life matters.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>And in Wisdom we will fix all of it,</p>
  <p>whether we are ready to recognize that or not, we are a Family, and as One, We&apos;ll fix it all.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>In that path we slowly walk together,</p>
  <p>towards Happiness and Fairness, and Joy.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>We will erase poverty and slavery with Universal Income and a Free Home with a picket fence.</p>
  <p>We will erase crime with Care and Prevention, and Fairness.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>We will erase war, blindness and stupidity, with Family Love and Wisdom.</p>
  <p>We will erase all problems that plague the Human Family, it is what a family does.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>One day, the world will stand united in fact,</p>
  <p>as opposed to being divided by opinion.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Not even the Universe can stand in our way,</p>
  <p>our way is the Human Family Way.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Like Wisdom,</p>
  <p>we are Unstoppable.</p>
