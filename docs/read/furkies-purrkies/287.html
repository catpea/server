  <p>Education in the context of an individual is the path to wisdom and greatness,</p>
  <p>in the context of the whole world, however, education is a path to World Peace.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Education is a very unusual thing,</p>
  <p>it enhances everything it can touch.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>To borrow from movies,</p>
  <p>education is our loading program.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>To borrow from computers,</p>
  <p>education is our operating system.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Without education, we reset back to some 20,000 or 50,000 years ago,</p>
  <p>we end up living in villages and inventing gods to help with harvest and afterlife.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Organized and mandatory education is a recent invention,</p>
  <p>it works up to middle school where teachers begin hiding inexperience behind abstractions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>When teaching a class of multiple students there is only time for lowest common denominators,</p>
  <p>everything gets hurried along and those who can&apos;t understand something begin memorizing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Within a few years everyone is temporarily memorizing everything to be sure they graduate,</p>
  <p>those who try to learn, are graded down under the threat of being held back and repeating the year.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Nobody is learning anything useful, everyone is memorizing,</p>
  <p>and teachers, grades, and threats of being held back only reinforce memorization.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>That is not education,</p>
  <p>that is memorization, acting.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Our loading program does not load,</p>
  <p>our operating system does not initialize.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>System crashes,</p>
  <p>and fathers eagerly send their boys to kill boys of other fathers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Politics becomes infested with pretenders, actors, con-men, and simple liars,</p>
  <p>voters simply don&apos;t think about electing people who show wisdom, who share books.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Lack of modern knowledge and the stress it begets will slow people down,</p>
  <p>it will be difficult to become wise, it may not be possible to become great.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Failure to propagate modern knowledge, seems to take the shape of,</p>
  <p>an uneducated majority, and a tiny educated minority without any voting power.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Once the failure of education takes hold,</p>
  <p>nothing can be done to fix the anomalies that occur afterwards.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The only way to help things along is to avoid the emergence of anomalies in the first place,</p>
  <p>and that means having a functional educational system.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>If it is not possible for a nation to teach its children,</p>
  <p>if the dream of organized, mandatory and standardized education is not realistic.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Personalized computer based, self education must be put in its place,</p>
  <p>the transition can be made easy by transitioning from grades to money, credits, or bonds.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The initial computer based curricula would grow the same way the world encyclopedia did,</p>
  <p>a little bit at a time, from all directions, as students are rewarded for following their curiosities.</p>

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I write this in year 2020 when it seems that all our old mistakes have reemerged,</p>
  <p>but what is actually going on is that mis-educated people are self assembling into desperate groups.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We are seeing groups self-reinforcing each other&apos;s beliefs based on color of skin,</p>
  <p>they come together to form communities because of an imaginary superiority a color.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We have a nation that treats women with he permanent legal status of a minor,</p>
  <p>of someone who is less than 18 years old, and politicians do not know to become enraged by this.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We have two nations that feature concentration camps,</p>
  <p>and the Land of the Free that practices torture under the guise of enhanced interrogation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>All of this is happening because of failure of schooling,</p>
  <p>inability of politicians to build.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Now, let me close with a heart warming thought experiment,</p>
  <p>which deep down I hope some magnificent nation a thousand years in the future may try for real.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We can all agree that, education is an investment in a nation&apos;s future,</p>
  <p>and that pretending to teach children by forcing them into memorization can destroy a nation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Let us say that, in this thought experiment, unless a better program is in place,</p>
  <p>countries should pay their students for achievement, not with imaginary letters but with real money.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Students in elementary should be getting paid just as much money as college students,</p>
  <p>and the amount that they bring home should be equal that of a prestigious job.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>After all what is more prestigious than the child&apos;s real knowledge,</p>
  <p>a child will soon become a politician, investor, leader, and inspiration for others to follow.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Making some $200,000 a year in 2020 money, is an amazing way for a nation to show respect its students,</p>
  <p>and it will proudly display how much more important they are in proportion to the defense budget.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Graduation, would leave a student not with crippling debt that can&apos;t be erased with bankruptcy,</p>
  <p>but with just about $3.2 million dollars in their account, that is how a graduate should start life.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The cost of this is irrelevant, these are hundreds of trillions of dollars per year that simply add to our national debt,</p>
  <p>this is what it means to have a country.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>What we see today, is poverty, children going hungry, fake education, ineffective politics,</p>
  <p>and research and legalization of dangerous drugs for the purpose of erasing stress, and PTSD born from poverty.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We cannot allow ourselves to live in the fantasy land,</p>
  <p>where it is OK for one nation to teach their children that another needs to be destroyed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We cannot allow ourselves to live in the fantasy of a limited number of abstract virtual pieces of paper,</p>
  <p>that sometimes make children die of starvation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Humanity, has outgrown the type of primitive small town thinking that we see today,</p>
  <p>it has outgrown it probably more than a hundred years ago when large cities started growing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>For those of you who are still laughing at my though experiment,</p>
  <p>take a lesson from the way early internet social networks would reform themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Initially switching to more automated, more statistics and probability oriented systems,</p>
  <p>would set their platforms on fire and cause waves of disturbance, but that is how things adapt to growing larger.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Call it growing pains, call it Love of Humanity, call it a nation at a stand still,</p>
  <p>in process of not just erasing poverty but creating an overabundance of wealth for its students.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Out of Love and Wisdom,</p>
  <p>out of Greatness of Vision, and of yearning for other nations to follow onward to World Peace, Safety and Equality.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And my final words are a question, if you created a thought experiment that represented the sad state of affairs today,</p>
  <p>what would that thought experiment be about, and what would it be trying to prove?</p>
