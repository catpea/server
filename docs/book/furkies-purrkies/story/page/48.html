because the world belongs to you.

Too many problems come from fantasies,
there are too many of them to mention.

So many of them are so miserable,
that no poem can hold them.

We can only really rise,
high and above anything and everything.

We can only really make real decisions,
once we have a good view of the world.

Until we are certain that we aren&#39;t under some influence,
we can&#39;t be certain that our decisions are entirely our own.

Great battles come to all of...</p>

is just as good,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;spending half a year traveling the Appalachian Trail is the most powerful example.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Above all, going to sleep when it gets dark, and rising to watch the sun rise,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is a great treasure, that brings great heath and strength.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Going forward every day, and slowing down to match the pace of nature,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;helps people have long thoughts and connects all their dots together.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Discomfort, is not part of learning and growing, or healing,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it is just that we must not succumb to fear and imaginary dragons.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Doing new things is not perfect, but it is not discomfort,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;discomfort is when someone is hurting you, or life is crushing you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;These are the situations that require drastic changes,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;not just a set of changes, but a long term series of changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Some people, presumably at-least armchair psychologists,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;say that we end up using a more logical side of our brain...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;But, I am sure that our brains are infinitely more complex than that,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and what is actually going on is that we are leaving a kind of depression behind.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;One of our main missions in life, is to live it to its fullest because, life is precious,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and that includes living in balance with nature, wisdom, and universe.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And while, I do admit that this sounds a wee bit hokey,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;the best way to personally explore ideas behind heath and balance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Is to try to imagine our elder selves,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;at say, 85 and a half years, young.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;It is hard to deny that, no one is more connected to the elder you, than you right now,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you can try to project your predispositions and try to imagine what the elder you is like.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Our energy is found in balanced living,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;we have to move away from stress, and depression, and overwork.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Our intelligence, and creativity, our memory, and ability to learn, and read books,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;requires that we take really good care of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;In school and at work, you will find your self facing,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;what I would call Profit Optimization.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Mediocre teachers will want a perfect mediocre score,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that is slightly above their last year statistics so that they may show improvement.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The average employer will want you to do more for less,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;or to get more out of you, without investing more into you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And that means,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;pushing you past your healthy balance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Encouraging use of medications that help with temporary memory at school,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and whatever pushes you into overwork and over performing at work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;apos;t do that,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you will be replaced by someone who is willing to live sick for the minimum you got paid, or less.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Allow me to digress, and say that to deal with both of these issues in a healthy fashion,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you can self-educate and and aim to build a serious of start-ups.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Now, when building your companies, you will be tasked with not pushing yourself,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;while it is easier to overwork in short term, it is not worth it in long term.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;You need heart, and soul, and long visions and thoughts to craft your own future,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and being stressed, depressed, and overworked will only take those powers away from you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Living healthy should be the easiest thing for you, cramming, overworking, stressing, depressing,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and squeezing every last bit of energy out of yourself, aught to be the more difficult path.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Just listen to what I am saying;&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;when you are healthy and in balance with your self, or with nature, whatever you conceive to be:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;You are at your most intelligent, and most creative, and strongest self,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you are also most beautiful, and I am sure at your funniest, in that worst of ways where no one is sure if are joking or dead serious.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;One of the ways to connect with your elder self,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is to make them better, is to grant them outrageous gifts from your youth.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Even if just to remind them,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;who the boss really is, or to make them smile in wonder.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Great beings often appear slightly odd and confusingly funny, just because of that,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;they are sending a message into their own future, to guarantee the health of their elder selves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Culture switching helps a person become unstuck,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it exposes them to new experiences, and removes old discomforts, and often making them more courageous.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;It is important to read books, and that means to live in a state that is conducive to inheriting lifetimes of knowledge,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and that state just can&amp;apos;t be found at places that aim to push you out of balance for their own profit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;It sounds terrible, but this is just a call to rising, to self balancing, to becoming an independent thinker,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;to leaving all influences whether perceptible of obscured, behind you, in a blur of a series of challenges.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;With each new step,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you will learn new things.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;With each new culture,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you will become more illuminated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And with each Great Endeavor,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you will become, greater.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&#34;,

             <p class="card-text small">Culture switching is the best way to learn, it is about discovering that not only one&#39;s own culture is fluid,
but also, that there is no standard culture, just a colorful bouquet.

I think most people assume that switching cultures
means living in some other country for a but moving around is just as good.

The point is not to be glued to a single spot,
but continue adapting to as many as possible.

Moreover, changing the way we live is just as good,
spending half a year traveling the Appalachian Trail...</p>

describing predispositions,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is a compass with a finely tuned needle.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Though rare, sometimes predispositions are about negative experiences,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;for example being smittened by all the things the Army Recruiter lies about at the Mall.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Underestimating the beautiful Appalachian or Pacific Crest Trails, is another example,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it is better to section hike a little bit at first, some take many years to section hike the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;But you know, as our horizon enlarges, even a tepid military experience can translate to greatness,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;working with governments to protect endangered species from dangerous poachers is one beautiful example.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Following our compass, and expanding our endless horizons will transform us,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;our predispositions will bloom like fields of wildflowers, colorful, unstoppable, unbreakable, endless.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And here I must state, in no uncertain terms, that I believe that,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;following a compass needle that is set by somebody or something else, will deeply hurt us, send us into sadness and regret.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We all start with a tiny and wobbly compass,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and the littlest of horizons.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Perhaps a penchant for disassembling favorite toys, and an impeccable library of all the outstanding places that are somehow unusual,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;from a cracked spider web filled WWII bunker to every river bridge that you can get under and get filthy from.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We have to cake care of who we are, and become more of it,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;because that expands our horizon in the most magnificent of ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The dusty bridges turn to dusty trails,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;toys become your endless computer programs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;You become an adventurer,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and an artist, and then so much more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I suspect, we will run out of road,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;if we follow an alien path.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;You are filled with gentle and unique predispositions,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that will bring you great wisdom when examined.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Until you do follow your dreams and arrive at all the shores that call to you,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you won&amp;apos;t really know what it is that you will become capable of, but it will be something far greater than you can image.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A great horizon, a great library of knowledge that helps you reason about new things by subtle analogy to what you already know,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;takes you beyond one word guesses of wishes like lawyer, soldier, or doctor, in to the world of Presidents and Prime Ministers, Peace Makers, and Scientists that further Human Kind.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And if it so turns out that the world is not yet ready for who you become,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;then you become a part of a bridge that aims to cover that gap, or restore something that has gone lost.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A President that the world is not yet ready to elect will work to help the world grow, a Peace Maker will aim to remind the world we are one,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;a Scientist that does not yet have the necessary tools and research, will work to invent them for those that are sure follow.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We must listen to our hearts, to our curiosities and learn to no end, look how much more you are than the child you once were,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that child could not have grasped the complexity of your being today, and you today, cannot grasp the complexity and beauty of your wisest self... keep learning, and keep following your own dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&#34;,

the roads there are obscured by confused and confusing chatter.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;It is not until we accept the responsibility for our own education,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that we will start learning, for real.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The biggest mistake is borders,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;groups of wealthy uneducated people coming together to decide the futures of their nations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;These men claim greatness,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and hold up their experience as their proof.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;But experience is no substitute for wisdom,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;on the surface experience makes a person indistinguishable from a wise one.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The first clue to distinguish the two, is found in length of vision,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;when they get around to speaking of problems of today, they will give excuses that they know - from experience - will hold up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;But they will dismiss the future entirely,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;because to speak of the future; a person needs a direction, a vision, an objective, a purpose, a wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Men of experience, are too small minded, too blind and limited, to shallow, to fragile,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;to see into things that have no impact on them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Our levels of education are insufficient to directly address the problems that we face today,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;there are too few well educated, knowledgeable and wise beings to repair anything right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;An uneducated voting majority is all to easily swayed and misled,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and our poverty will prevent our generation from re-learning.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;One of the worst things about general poverty,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is that it induces a poverty of mind, out of lack of time, out of stress, fear, and discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Reality, has no borders, as climate change and pandemics show us,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;in reality we are one human family.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And in reality, poverty is tearing the world apart,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it is keeping us weak.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;In reality, a teenager in a dictatorship on the other side of the world,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is your friend, they would love you if you sent them popular snacks from your city, some photos and music.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;They are family,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;there are people out there who would be genuinely kinder to you than some of your own family.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;It is sooooo sad that we label each other with the names of our nations,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and return to tend to whatever poverty we are facing at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Internet, student exchange, programs like Peace Corps,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and documents like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights help us see in our confused state.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;But it is just a tiny sliver of light,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;poverty of mind alone is almost unaffected by it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;United Nations has its hands tied,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;without an appropriate level of education General Assembly will stand in a constant state of disagreement.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Without a plan to unite, and eliminate poverty,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;we are all equally wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And we can&amp;apos;t have Unity and Prosperity without Knowledge and Wisdom,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;liars would instantly invent something that they stand to lose, and tear the world right up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Do you hear me, do you see what I am saying,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;we are one, it is all of us, or none.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The way to fix it,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is by inventing educational programs that really help children to knowledge, wisdom and greatness.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Because until we hold long term visions fueled by Knowledge and Wisdom,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;the only thing we can agree on, is what the liars want us to believe in.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Real education is the thing that leads us to have thoughts independent to what is on TV and in News Papers,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it helps us see who the liars, and mark my words for this sorry year, even when they assume a pleasing shape.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Real Education grants us Intellectual Independence,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;where audio book by book we all independently gain a valid grasp on reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Organized education will always bend under the threat of being defunded or kept in poverty,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it will help to invent brand name institutions that are only better in the name, but all equally ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Organized education will rip talent out of children, it will sand it down until they are all equally lost,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;mixed with poverty most parents won&amp;apos;t even be granted the ability to care about what is happening to the minds of their children, because the babysitting is good.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Organized education ends up causing harm to children&amp;apos;s intellectual development,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it holds them back and causes so much stress that it is impossible to learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Organized education is such a problem, that even the best minds of our generations,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;are still thinking about &amp;quot;Free College&amp;quot; - about paying those fraudulent institutions - instead of funding ones that are capable of Real Education.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Things are pretty bad, thankfully, we are infinite in our capacity to deal with real dangers,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;especially the ones that tear tear our family apart.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Real education is based on students&amp;apos; predispositions,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and curiosities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;For example, when someone is interested in the moon or stars at night,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that marks an entry point into Science Fiction, Astrophysics, Astrography and if they continue to care, Optics, Mathematics, Physics, Writing and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Most children won&amp;apos;t care for stars very long, because they are interested in exploring all of the universe,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and that is even better because then there is a multitude of passage ways they can use to walk through the sciences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;But it has to be their own walking, their own direction, and at their own pace,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;we have to honor their predispositions and curiosities, the students are the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We have to remove grades, tests, graduation, class rooms, time divisions, subject divisions, rows of seats, groupings of any kind be it age or area of study,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;we have to replace the teacher with personalized learning and tutors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And we have to give the students what they need, a telescope, a fast single board computer with all the sensors and servos they could ever need,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;they need the ability to launch satellites, to operate small remotely operated submarines and small drones, they need access to things they are curious about.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;If a student is walking the wrong path, then it is a path that has been been walked many times before, they are asking a question, and they need powerful answers,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;they have to see what war is like, what prisons are like, what concentration camps are like - and what love is like - and they will learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;At the time of writing this in 2020, I realized that there are three nations that operate concentrations camps,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;which is probably to say, that there are many; and they need to see that too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;They need to see gang violence, and if they are still around then meet up with Father Gregory Boyle&amp;apos;s boys,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;for they have surely become Great Beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Nothing goes wrong in real education,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;real education is about reality, about really growing up, and really being human.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And when these students grow up, become voters, Senators and Congresswomen and Congressmen,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;then the liars, and pretenders, will lose their hold on humanity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And then the members of General Assembly of United nations,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;can finally have their day, in agreement and unity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;My friends,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;never lose hope.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;If something important can&amp;apos;t happen today,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it only means that you are to begin building the bridge, for others to eventually get there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Real Education is the first step,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;the second is actually many overlapping steps that will happen all at once, all around the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;What you have to do is make sure that the students get to own or hold in their own hands the many tools that they need,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;to learn, and explore the Human Condition, and The Sciences, and The World, and The Stars; as those are their countless bookmarks and the steppingstones to their boundless steps.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The children want to learn,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and that is all the hope Humanity will ever need.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&#34;,

             <p class="card-text small">Mistakes and Misunderstandings divide Humanity today,
noting can be done because varying levels of education interfere with unity.

One of the biggest mistakes is ineffective education
tricking students into believing that they are educated.

Mis-education, fake education, ineffective education makes us blind,
truths and facts are drowned in an ocean of conflicting and equally wrong opinions.

Real education, is the key to unity, to a common grasp on reality,
but all the roads there are obscured by...</p>

&amp;quot;How were we supposed to know?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A solid foundation in reality is a good start in life,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;sometimes we don&amp;apos;t figure things out until it is too late.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I know this poem caught you early,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you have a long time to ponder all this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And that too is a good start,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;a proper Gentlelady or Gentleman questions everything, and takes nothing for granted.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I hope you are still in Middle School or High School,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and you get to walk to your desk, with a heavy step.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Slouch, perk up your ears like a Lion,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and take the whole situation apart.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The kids in the back figured it out already,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but that is as far as they got, they need more answers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;They need you!&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;the leader.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Maybe you can try thinking about debates,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;learning from the way Great Beings argue the pretenders or the uneducated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;You are already given reasons,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;now you need to find the truth.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;It is never too early,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;to begin to question everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;One of the smallest arguments we are given, is the argument for mathematics,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;well, it used to be given, it was that we aren&amp;apos;t always going to have a calculator on hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Though it is cute to say that we have smart phones with calculators that have advanced mode,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;there is a darker side to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Mathematics is not enough,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;we need Programming, and we need to be Shell Literate as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Vapid and Insipid Mathematics poisoned the beauty of Science,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;memorization of formulas obscured the simpler beauty beneath.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Memorization is another problem,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;look how carefully you are nudged to abandon reason and understanding in favor of memorization.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The guillotine of failing a class because you tried to learn everything,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;instead of passing with a straight A+ for merely cramming for the test - DOES chop your head off.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Look how proud your teacher is, that disingenuous show of teeth,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;up for another raise, sold you for a paycheck and on some simple memes that you can get from a calendar.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;One of the biggest reasons given to you,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is that you need a Diploma to get a Job.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I would like you to consider, that perhaps a real diploma,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is one that a University goes out of their way to give; you for your Great Achievements.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The diploma you receive at the end of your stay in school,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;while it grants you access to higher institutions and more advanced jobs...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;...it will not prevent those jobs from endangering or sacrificing you for profit,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;the best lies are the ones that others maneuver you into believing, choices you would never make without their poison.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Your life, does not compare to other lives, no matter how precious or numerous,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;there is no Life Arithmetic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The closest you can get to a formula is this wonderful contradiction:&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Each life is more important than the other.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;If someone ever asks you to do something for the greater good, you are not sacrifice,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you quit your job or await your dishonorable discharge, and begin your search for Enlightenment and Wisdom, onward to becoming a Great Being.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;If the best job you can possibly get, holds some measure of risk,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;then you are going to need to try harder.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;In case you are wondering,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;- I care, and you can&amp;apos;t undo that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The harder, or the less worn path,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is that of becoming an Independent Inventor and Entrepreneur.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And you are not going to be the first or only one,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;find the others, find a couple of co-founders, learn from your Noble Failures as well as Triumphant Successes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;So when someone says &amp;quot;Diploma&amp;quot;,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you reply; &amp;quot;Check Your Premise&amp;quot;, to quote an old friend.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;When they say calculator,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you say: &amp;quot;Help me with programming not memorizing formulas.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;When they box you in to memorize,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you get the others to drop the class, because you need a real education, one that helps you to wisdom and greatness.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;While governments are smart enough to encourage learning,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;as evidenced by mandatory education, they are not smart enough to tell a real education from a fake one.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I suspect the intelligence of governments is dictated purely by the voters,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;in that wise people will not vote in uneducated representatives.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;But you see the small catch-22 or egg and chicken problem,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;a government can&amp;apos;t easily become intelligent enough to encourage real education, without majority of voters being educated for real.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The way to do boot the process and hopefully sustain it,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is to mirror the educational paths of pioneers and founders, in a short: Self Education.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Self education is not that outrageous,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that is what real schools are supposed to encourage you to do, without any interference.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And let me underline that interference will destroy self education,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;grades, cookie cutter curricula, the threat of repeating classes or even semesters can destroy a beautiful and delicate mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Self education is like learning to walk, except this time you learn to move in the Universe,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and instead of getting your feet to move quite right, you are trying to find the audio books that somewhat fit what you already know.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Finally on a related subject, it hurts me to say it, but &amp;quot;Free College&amp;quot; is not quite right,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it should be &amp;quot;Free Real and Effective Education that Shows Real Results&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Compare that to the an Important Vaccine, we don&amp;apos;t need a mere Free Shot of Something spelled out with weasel words,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;we need a real and effective vaccine that shows real results across millions of participants.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;You should not allow yourself to think of College or University as something that gets you a good job,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;a good job is nothing, the dumbest of liars can get you fired if you get in their way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The thing you must look for is Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;as that opens all the gateways ahead of you; but more importantly that path is most worthy of you, it is the most human and healthiest of paths.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;All you need to start is a small bowl of ice cream, an electric blanket, a fine pillow, a comfy bed,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and a narrated book by Carl Sagan, or Neil deGrasse Tyson, or Bill Bryson.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And then as you get going, and maybe take to liking new titles from best-seller lists and new authors you have never heard of,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;find a a small, perhaps, pocket sized, well respected book on Bush Craft, and start getting ready for your first tiny venture into the Wild by buying a backpack and a tent...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;You will need a pair of cut proof gloves, a 16&amp;quot; Bowie knife (don&amp;apos;t do 14&amp;quot;), get high quality Damascus, Stag Horn Handle, fine leather sheath, full tang, obviously...&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and a second actually useful Bush Craft Knife, and then splurge on a sharp fordable hand saw you can bring along to all adventures, and get an audio book, and fire going as everyone else is still hacking away.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;As you read more and more,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and things start making sense, as you slowly and independently begin forming an accurate view of the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Bring a cheerful friend, or your mum, to a near by state park,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;one with a fine beach and a tidy nick-knack store that also doubles as a hot dog stand and perhaps serves a fine and spicy vegetarian alternative.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Later on, grab couple of lovely and trusting friends,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;fool enough to try to through-hike the Applachin Trail with you in one go from Springer Mountain to Mount Katahdin.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Though I highly recommend section hiking at first,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and also, please, please, visit Henry at Walden Pond each time you climb Katahdin.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;You know, it is hard to miss the fact that a tent in bear country makes for a fine dorm room,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and that each white blaze you meet on the AT, doubles as an A+ that no teacher could possibly give you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And that each time you make it up Katahdin with a hundred new books on your mind,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you do graduate ever higher.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I think both Henry and the Mountain grant you some of their height&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;- I know for certain without a doubt; and I know you can feel it too: You are meant to become a Great Being.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&#34;,

             <p class="card-text small">Just because the world is being tardy,
it does not mean you should be too.

In deed, if you fail to slowly make haste,
then the world will become darker for it.

Every Human must shine,
with Enlightenment.

I know it is hard to accept
that schools may not be working.

We all have so little,
and now even more even rugs are pulled from beneath our feet.

There is other stuff too,
from bad parenting to mutually assured destruction.

I am sorry, if you are looking for answers,
the best answers any of them...</p>

predispositions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;No one has the right to hold you in contempt for your talents,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;no one has the right to tell you who you should become.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;All pursuits of excellence lead to Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;the longer it takes the more precious the result.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Ignore the so called teachers that will try to control you, or sway you off your path,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;their only wish is to make their own lives easier even if it means sacrificing who you are.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Real education is somehow completely misunderstood,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and people do end up getting lost in life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;For example, some may enjoy a single subject,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and fall behind on all the rest.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Then, to fix their grades,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;they are made to focus on fixing subjects that they are bad at.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;In the process they interrupt themselves,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;they are made to interfere with their own, more-real education.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And, here the beneficiary is the teacher and the dean,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and the reward is eventual raises for keeping GPAs stable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Long after these frauds are gone,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;their victims suffer, never having found a comfortable place.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, even after the fools are gone people continue feeling guilt for their talents,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;they become convinced that doodles are dumb, and poems are stupid.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;It is hard to find happiness in doing things that we don&amp;apos;t care about,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it maybe impossible even.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A life void of happiness,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is a life of depression and constant anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Even the smallest of our predispositions will develop into unique greatness,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;a greatness that is hard to see at first, hard to reason about.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Let me make this clear, Real Education is not about getting a job,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it is about becoming a Great Being, who has much more to add.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And some people,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;are a little bit ahead of their time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;For example kids that like to fly drones,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;may never fully get into it, unless...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;they get access to drones equipped with cameras,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that they can steer through a VR helmet, as if they were piloting them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;If they stick with it,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;they will enter electronics, mathematics and software development.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;If they get bored, or can&amp;apos;t afford the hardware,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;then they will lose something of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Rule of thumb here,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is to take a predisposition all the way, at all cost.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Hobbies or silly interests are gateways into sciences,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and should always be honored and seen as something very special.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;One massive problem is the teachers and parents,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;who when lacking similar predispositions will tend to destroy talent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And they do it because they don&amp;apos;t want their kid to stick out,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;they don&amp;apos;t need the extras and the questions that come along with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;They may say that games are for children,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and talents are useless.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;They will say such things because they can&amp;apos;t handle life,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;as someone took their talent away and now everything is cumbersome and more than they bargain for.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Coupled with organized and standardized schooling&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that divide subjects into meaninglessness and noise that can only be memorized.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Sprinkle in some bullies,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that hate kids that stick out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;All that on top of already bad grades,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;as the student may not even be aware that everyone is just memorizing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And much is lost,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and most permanently.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Real Education is a source of joy, strength,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and contributes to love of life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The effects of real education&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;are hard to describe.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;It is the different between a pop star, and a girl forced to repeat the semester because she used to like music.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;It is the difference between,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;a quickly forgotten politician and a famous philosopher that continues to inspire generations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Between a writer that dabbles in forgettable romance novels,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and one that helps us to understand a strange world of &lt;a href=\&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkPR4Rcf4ww\&#34;&gt;tyranny without tyrants&lt;/a&gt; one that we must reject.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Real education creates beings that change lives,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;their Works come out of Greatness, nobly fueled by Wisdom and Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;To deny the becoming of a Great Being is to deny Growing Up,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it means to deny joy, happiness, and love of life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Everyone is acting as if Greatness and Great Wisdom is rare,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;all the while they are stopping each other from a Real Education.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;It is Real Education that brings people into areas of Knowledge that they are predisposed to further,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;granting them Wisdom, and eventually Greatness.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;People who conspire against talent,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;are Guidance Counselors, Teachers, and Parents, precisely those who are meant to encourage it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We must honor the talents and predispositions of the younger generations,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;by building personalized educational systems that lead them to Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We must remove all barriers that stand in their way,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;the future of the world is in their hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&#34;,

             <p class="card-text small">Real Education, makes you, more you,
it greatly enhances your all predispositions.

No one has the right to hold you in contempt for your talents,
no one has the right to tell you who you should become.

All pursuits of excellence lead to Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness,
the longer it takes the more precious the result.

Ignore the so called teachers that will try to control you, or sway you off your path,
their only wish is to make their own lives easier even if it means sacrificing who you are.
