idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Independent education is one that is paved with curiosities,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and helped along with top-selling non fiction, including narrated books.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Majority of world&amp;apos;s top selling books&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;are written by well educated and well meaning authors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Lack of education breeds desperation,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;not only will the voters be confused, but the politicians won&amp;apos;t understand them either.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A world where leaders place their needs above the people they swore to represent,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and do the bare minimum for maximum personal gains, is a world that needs vision.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, a well educated, knowledgeable and wise voting majority,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;isn&amp;apos;t one to get confused, or become mislead, easily.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A vision is always something that most of humanity has already agreed on,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;though they might have forgotten parts here and there, or worded them differently.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Climate Stabilization&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Human Dignity&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;World Peace&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Universal Human Rights&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;World Disarmament&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Functional Education&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;End Of Poverty All Around The World&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Universal Basic Income&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;World Unity&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Justice&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Authenticity, and Truth.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;As we progress from well-read, to knowledgeable, to wise, and onward to our greatness,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;we will collect and hold in our hearts many such Hopes and Dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;At first they may seem like words or beautiful ideas,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but as we look into Memoirs, and beloved and honored works of great story tellers, they will become more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;With a few dozen books a concept that has been lost on leaders of humanity,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;will come to life in our hearts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Rather than trying to flawlessly comprehend the world,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;which may not be possible due to too many liars who by definition lack in vision, and are merely responding to stimuli for maximum self gain.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We gain the ability hold up several of our most beloved Aims, Hopes and Dreams,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and ask what are the leaders doing to fulfill them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;It is much easier to look at a leader&amp;apos;s sum of history,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and notice that they have never done anything meaningful for World Peace and Elimination of Poverty, than to await their promises to come true.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We can then ask, if we want to vote on people who do not recognize World Peace and Elimination of Poverty as an aim,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and what those people must be like.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;More importantly, holding a meaningful vision helps us grow up stronger and faster,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;helps us focus our energies and curiosities on things that we become passionate about.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;When a wise voting majority becomes passionate about Human Dignity,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;the strength that arises from Unity of Vision can easily repair World&amp;apos;s Nations and help Humanity Grow.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Without a wise consensus things that are concurring around the world are probably mostly random,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;with elections won by those who spend most money on taking on a pleasing shape, and disasters being a predictable result of corruption and shortsightedness.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;It is hard to blame leaders and voters for something as disabling as lack of education,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;people who lack knowledge pave their ways with their best intentions, alas Humanity&amp;apos;s most beloved works of non-fiction must come first, lest we continue repeating the same old mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;There is nothing difficult&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;about falling in love with Good Ideas,&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;When we take to Adventures and Books, and a new book surprises us with a like selection of Hopes and Dreams,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;we can only discover how connected we all really are, that we are in fact one big family.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;What are your Hopes and Dreams?&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;What is your Vision of The Future Of Humanity?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&#34;,

sometimes all you need is a vision of a better one.

The world is difficult to grasp because people in authority,
have interests that differ from, the people that vote on them.

Furthermore, low quality schools,
will prevent the voter from making correct choices.

The uneducated or misled majority,

This is why independent, self education,

Yeah, I guess you can&#39;t be a Doctor then,

&lt;p&gt;to become in-compressible, and unbreakable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Life must go on, we must rise against all odds,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;no evil, no meaningless suffering, no liar is to hold us down.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The most powerful part of us that drives all the rest,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Wisdom is like a flower, and it grows within books,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;whatever our challenge, great beings faced similar circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And so that their aches did not get lost,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;they turned them into wisdom, and the only way to reliably share wisdom is books.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A well narrated book can give a person great strength in a very short time,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and when our soul hurts the most our mind becomes extremely receptive to wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;It is best, I think, to read books, or listen to their narrated versions,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Books also enhance our decision making,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;so that we may avoid hopelessness altogether.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The only thing that can give us great trouble,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is not having access to well respected and meaningful books that change lives with wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Because then we will need to rebuild the path to greatness from zero,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and that may take decades if not more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;There is a problem with books because reading them is not the best way to inherit their wisdom,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;the best way is to have them beautifully read to us.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Not only that but in order to hear the narrator well,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;we need a healthy mind and a balanced existence, a kind of a long and hard vacation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We need the healing power of nature, of hills, trees, moss and fern,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;little woodland springs, an occasional beach, warm nights and fragrant mornings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;To understand a book, you need a fine narrator, and thick smell of pine trees,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;a cracking bonfire or cabin fireplace, and the certainty of knowing that you have tomorrow for yourself as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We are unable to inherit knowledge from books when our life is stressful,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;in stress the best we can do is temporary memorize.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;But we have to appreciate the content of what is being said,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;not merely the words themselves, but the birth and life of the idea behind them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Learning requires the creation of a map or scaffold,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and that can only be built when we love ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And once wisdom finally takes root within us, it cannot be removed in any way, wisdom grows, almost on its own,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it grants us solutions to new problems by subtle analogy to that which we already understand.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And wisdom spreads, it is hard not to share good ideas,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and it is hard to stop them from being shared.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Once equipped with wisdom,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;we can hear the chains of misfortune dragging a mile away, and we are, in a way, ready.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We stand with the many others that we met in books, but now creating a family in time and space,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and now we fully appreciate their struggles and eventual triumph, and them taking the time to share their hard won wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And then we rise, we rise out of it all,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;in our struggle wisdom will bloom within us multiplying our strengths to no end.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Later in life we will be able to heal others,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;help them with their thoughts and towards their own synthesis of wisdom, and helping them to become just as unbreakable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&#34;,

and I quote:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How in the hell could a man enjoy being awakened at 8:30 a.m. by an alarm clock,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;leap out of bed, dress, force-feed, s*it, p*ss, brush teeth and hair,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and fight traffic to get to a place where essentially you made lots of money for somebody else and were asked to be grateful for the opportunity to do so?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Henry Thoreau, or Socrates reminds us,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that we need to know what life is, and the following quote is from Walden.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;to front only the essential facts of life,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear;&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;to cut a broad swath and shave close,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;These are great beings, they are immortal, full of wisdom and knowledge,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it is really important to - if not befriend them - then to at least answer their questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Like I said, life is so long that you are going to forget a bunch of years,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and not even feel bad about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;But lowering ourselves into a decades long routine,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that we may kind of regret later on, is not good.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;While life is long,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;we don&amp;apos;t get a do over, so we have to make sure that we are headed towards a good and healthy future, an authentic future.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;All I am saying, is that you must carefully examine life,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;because there are too many people out there that will try to take advantage of your inexperience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;By examining life, by listening to great beings with large libraries of experiences, mistakes, failures and triumphs,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you will learn from their life, and get a really good idea of where you really want to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And more than that,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you can take multiple paths.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;For example become a writer and a poet, first; and then go back to Med School after you crossed the Appalachian Trail a couple of times,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and after you fought some Angry Bears and Mountain Lions with little more than Courage and some sharp Nail Clippers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&#34;,

and each day is a gift.

Life is not short, life is so long,
that you are going to forget a bunch a stuff, and not care.

But it is possible to run in circles;
pretend to learn, work hard at a job you hate, and never really grow up.

It is easy to avoid this,
we just need to listen to some deeply fascinating and inspiring audio books on a long, beautiful and healthy adventure.

But also, we can&#39;t really return from the adventure,
we have to continue climbing at the same...</p>
