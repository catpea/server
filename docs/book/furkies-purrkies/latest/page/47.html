and we hold many Cognitive Biases that can harm us.

It is really important to question everything,
all the Sciences were born this way.

The sciences are a product of the Scientific Principle,
a product of the search for truth by means of real evidence, clear thinking and healthy skepticism.

Our world is changing very quickly,
but almost all the major mistakes Humanity has made, are currently being repeated.

The world has also become more...</p>

because that would require a standardized life.

A life in which we are only passionate about
what we are told to be passionate about.

A life, where memorization,

My friends, the standardization of your existence,
is something that every lazy teacher, evil C.E.O., mad dictator, cult leader, and crooked politician dreams about.

A standardized existence is one
where your mind is taken from you.

             <p class="card-text small">Without reading powerful books written by wise beings,
all we can really do is come up with half-baked conspiracy theories.

Does High School work?
or does it destroy creativity, uniqueness, and self esteem.

Does college work?
Or is everyone participating in a mutually beneficial dog an pony show?

Are we supposed to just get a job? or or build a career?
And what about Start-ups and Entrepreneurship and Invention?

These questions matter, if you are in highs school,
and high school isn&#39;t working, or...</p>

grow.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;It is not that the world is too difficult to grasp,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but that, too many people are suffering from lack of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Knowledge is found in books, best experience in their audio form,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and on a pleasant and relaxing adventure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Books whose authors are admired for their hard work, clarity of long therm vision,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;intelligence, wisdom, and often a wonderful sense of humor.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Alas, far too many people take to relive their fears by,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;by constructing a view of the world they can understand and control.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;All fantasies will eventually call for reinforcement,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and as history shows, at any, and all cost.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Be it something as tiny as the number of likes on a social network,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;as odd as the status that pointlessly-expensive-cars bring.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Or something as heartbreaking as political systems,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;where fathers will easily send their children to kill each other in battle fields.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A fantasy will call for reinforcement,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;to keep it going to make it last, and no price will ever be too big.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Reality, is much harsher and not as comfortable or easy to grasp,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;will call for constant effort, hard earned foresight, real and lasting results to our endeavors, and authentic dignity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;In reality; color of skin, numbered of colored pieces of paper, or the colors of a flag,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;do not define who is superior, and who is inferior, who is better and who is worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;In fantasy, poverty and war, are facts of life,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;in reality, Love, Health, and World Peace, are, the most beautiful rewards for the most difficult of achievements.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;In fantasy we crated tens of thousands of gods and as many battles in their worship,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;in reality we invent Flight, try to get to the Moon for no clear reason, and even fantasize about Interstellar Travel to cross the galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;In reality there is no evil, just a steady and colorful progress forward, we build Nuclear Plants and not Nuclear Missiles,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;in fantasy evil oozes from the cracks that mad men must keep patching to prevent their small minds from falling to a thousand pieces.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Fantasies spread with culture,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;they quite imperceptibly trick us into thinking of ourselves as other than we really are.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;For example, if you don&amp;apos;t believe you can be a genius,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you will not be able to become one, you&amp;apos;ll never aim for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The longer you delay, the more obstacles will arise in your path&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;if you don&amp;apos;t believe you can cross that challenge, you won&amp;apos;t even try.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;If you grant others control over your time, or life,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you will only limit yourself and how far you can travel.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Your mind is powerful enough to host cities of thoughts and dreams of, any size,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;the only limit to your intelligence is the ability to mistakenly stop your self by accepting some falsehood.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Love, genius, empathy, foresight and insight, and spirituality exist within us all,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but without knowledge and eventual wisdom they too are limited and fall short.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Yes, at first, the real world is unknown to us,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but it is not meant to frighten us into creating fantasies that we think we can grasp.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;It simply requires that we listen to a hundred books,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;take a moment to explore the world around us with our new found experience...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And then very slowly and very gently as our long lives unfold,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;listen to, and read, just about nine hundred more as not to ever fall short, and always have a beautiful story to tell.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We are sure to become wise, with all the building blocks we gain from books,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and then, if should we wish, we can turn right around and create some new books for others to read, and grow up with.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Do not be scared my friends,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;as scary as poverty is, its power flows precisely from lack of education, wisdom and above all foresight.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The more knowledgeable and wiser the world,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;the more overwhelming the force to crush poverty.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Growing up to become knowledgeable and wise as opposed to merely age in some easy fantasy,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is critical for our mental health and well being.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A thousand books you can listen to while traveling worlds most beautiful hiking trails,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is hardly a challenge, it shouldn&amp;apos;t even be seen as a inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Inheriting real and functional knowledge, that has a powerful and lasting impact on our growing up,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that enriches and enhances our decision making bringing us clear visions and impossible dreams is a great reward.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Becoming broke, or homeless, never being able to get a job, and being seen as a waste of life,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is not something that can happen to a wise a beautiful person that rejects fantasies in search of truths.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And it is important to remember,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that we can&amp;apos;t graduate a by cramming and temporary memorizing disconnected facts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A fake education,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is a meaningless education.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Companies known for hiring such inauthentic individuals are full of life draining liars and pretenders and probably in high positions,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;whatever they build cannot be built with vision and wisdom, it can only self destruct.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Once you become self educated,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you are granted the opportunity to build your own companies with foresight and invention.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;My dear reader, I would bet building an open and grade-free school that actually educates its students will be high up on your to-do list.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Building companies only becomes stressful when you build them for their own sake due to lack of vision,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;when you enter on the path towards wisdom, you won&amp;apos;t merely aim to impress investors, you will move generations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;It is OK to blindly set off towards wisdom,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it is one of the few leaps of faith that are worth the while.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Whatever your aims, may you inspire countless dreamers to greatness,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and may you reject all fantasy, holding authenticity and wisdom as the highest of values.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&#34;,

             <p class="card-text small">All that has ever gone wrong,
has gone wrong due to rejecting realities, and accepting, fantasies.

To deny truth, is to create a terrible fantasy,
and no human being should ever be committed to one - as life is far too precious.

Yes, fantasies in a sickly way are more comfortable,
than the authentic life that unfolds by rules independent from our wishes.

But rejecting pleasant fantasies is no different
than the rejection of drugs.

It is simply not who we are,
and not where healthy people wish to be...</p>
