             <p class="card-text small">We, or the younger generations may find ourselves in situations where life does not make sense,
where too many things are contradictory, ineffective, and too broken to be of any real use.

When we are children we are taught falsehoods,
indoctrinated into religions, made to think of politics as special, and schools as critical.

We have no chance to question anything,
we have no experience at all.

Religions, broken politics and ineffective schools feed on blind belief,
if we taught children the truth...</p>

afternoon is a pretty good low.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A pretty good height to reach is either ten miles by foot,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;or 1,500 miles by car where it usually involves a beach somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Moreover, you need a team deadline, a snooze button, a soon to end semester,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and an ungrateful team where you do all the work, add a few bullies...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and your co-worker whispering:&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why did she get a raise, she doesn&amp;apos;t know anything&amp;quot; - emphasizing &amp;quot;she doesn&amp;apos;t know&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;While not purrfect, this is a really good start,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and erasing the deadline from its existence, is a sweet-sweet cherry on top.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;There are too more things you could use, a handful or ungrateful friends,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and a really well thought out backpack, and a large solar charger you can hang on the back.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;See, you are not just headed for Key West and back,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I m sure you will stop at all the antique stores, and hopefully pawn shops as they have good stuff too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A good pawn shop somewhere down in Florida or by an ocean is sure to have a cheap Wet Suit,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it is a little known fact that they aid your buoyancy, it is like wrapping your self in a wee boat.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I think it is really important to consider stopping by the highway accessible State Parks,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;they are usually there because something beautiful is going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;You never know what you find, it could be a little lake, maybe enormous dunes,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it could be a hill with a historic watchtower of a lookout, or it could be a stable, with horses.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Personally, I think it is disrespectful for a man to sit on a poor animal,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but it is fine for a woman.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And you certainly don&amp;apos;t want to realize come your late golden age,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that you never rode a horse, and yet you always knew that you were a cowgirl at heart.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Now, you see what I am saying, you go from a warm and cozy blanket on a lazy afternoon, facing an ugly week,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;to wondering how to make the damn animal stop galloping, because by now you are in the middle of the woods.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;An hour later as you lead your new equine fiend back,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it won&amp;apos;t be just that you soul and heart are filling with beauty...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;...but somehow you will also gain a sense for how irrelevant your deadline was,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;how nearly falling from your new spirit animal and soul-mate combined to repair your perspective.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;It is never enough to merely dump indoctrination and repair misconceptions,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;there is also a kind of a fog-of-war that luls you into a life that frankly, you already made too many compromises for.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;In real life you do things out of love, in the other kind of life you compromise,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and do that long enough and you will find yourself hardly noticing that you are walking a stranger&amp;apos;s road - that ain&amp;apos;t good.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Eventually, you pet and pat you horse, give the caretaker a smile,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and stop at the next park.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The more stops you make, the more you will heal and the faster you will catch up with growing up,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you can almost feel it in your hands, they will fell empty without a journal.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Now, let me just pause here for a second, and remind you, that you are removing unimportant things from your life,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;be good to your journal, failing that get a second one, as the first one won&amp;apos;t last long at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Don&amp;apos;t make the same mistake I did, I bought this beautiful leather bound thing,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and figured why don&amp;apos;t I use a pencil at first...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;...smart right?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;It took me hours to try to erase the pages, and most of them still had annoying little bits of letters on it,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;treat your journal like a friend, and speak in wee little bits.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;If you want to speak at length,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;do what I am doing, give advice, make a little audio file and put it on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Healing will make it so that you will want to erase it because it will sound &amp;quot;dumb&amp;quot; to you after a bit,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but that is only because you are growing really quickly, catching up, others still need the simpler thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A lot of people will stay in bed,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;they will meet the deadline, and that snooze button will slowly turn their joy of life off.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;There is still hope for them, maybe the boss will be super crazy and mean, hopefully,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;she could then come around and tell them &amp;quot;Hey! you will never get a raise again?&amp;quot;, that could still snap them out of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;But, if the boss is not fully crazed,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you are their last hope.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The trouble you go through to learn to jog,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;or try to hit every state park, without really caring much for actually making it to Key West.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;As all end of the road towns are tourist traps,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;so, it is true when they say it is the journey, not the destination.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Except maybe for those six toed cats that Ernest Hemingway left behind in his Key West home,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;very few things will surprise you with independence, and a cat probably capable of of grasping tools is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Yeah, all the trouble, and little pit stops, and furry or maned discoveries, serve as a call to health,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;to all those who are almost ready for it, but not quite there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;No human should lead the life of a house cat,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;we are very dynamic, and doing beautiful unusual things helps us stay healthy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;One, time, I camped next to a couple that brought their two year old to a hike-in site,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it was clearly the husband&amp;apos;s idea, the wife was angry, and the kid was crying...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;It was a nice try, but they needed more vacations, and more babysitters,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and not just camping, but jogging, trail running, and a plan to visit all the famous lighthouses.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I am sure she loved the trouble of camping when they started dating,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;now the inconvenience of it all was making the poor lady, angry, out of the storm of stress.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I am certain, that she was blaming her self for it,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and thinking of her self as just that kind of a person, nobody is angry like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Between the three of them, they had everything in the universe, except the trouble was so overwhelming and the fog-of-war so thick.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;That this, clearly, mighty and courageous mom, was only racing forward to get stuff done.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;They stayed the weekend,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but they needed at least three weeks if not months.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;They needed to stop racing forward,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;they needed more adventures, more &amp;quot;inconvenience&amp;quot;, more trouble-making as I call it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;That woman in particular struck me as someone who needed to run the Western States 100,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;she had the power for it, no, she has a soul for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;See emanated the mana that bespoke that,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;the standard marathons needed to qualify for western states meant nothing to her, it was just a blistering formality.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Anyway, still a glorious couple,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and their little one will surely grow up to be an adventurer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Aside from a raccoon I named Friday, using his cute little hands to soil my hot dog buns,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that week brought in another mighty being - this time a teenage boy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;His father passed away, and he pushed himself too far,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;the psychologist put him on permanent medicine.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I had the great honor of speaking to him, he told me he slept in fields and ditches,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but he had his sister, or mom, looking out for him.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;He was a Powerful Troublemaker,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I told him we need to care for ourselves, our bodies need vitamins, electrolytes, our minds need whatever they need.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There is no such thing as crazy,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you just went through a lot in life, it was your life that got crazy.&amp;quot; - I said to him.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A thousand miles on a bicycle, which according to my maps requires a little trip to Canada, and a ferry,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is all the proof needed that the kid was really special.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I returned to my camp, and a day or two later,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;a shadowy figure visited him, his mom probably, and without me paying attention I&amp;apos;ve noticed it was a slow and mighty, and very heavy conversation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Knowing he was well, I hope he continued his bicycling, at least to the upper peninsula,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;though there was a ferry near by, so maybe he was headed for Chicago, I hope they both went.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;See, here is a child well on his way to become a great being,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;he was learning wisdom, and all he needed was backpack, a bicycle, and a thousand miles of road.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Trouble-making is no joke, it an art,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and it is medicine worthy of great heroes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;If you, my Dear Reader, get stuck, or stung, or scared, or get stuck in a fog of war,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;know that it is not a time to try harder, and push harder, and let me tell you why without mincing words:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Because you are absolutely irreplaceable,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and - what you think your flaws are - aren&amp;apos;t, they are not flaws, this is your uniqueness.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;You will only exist once in the universe,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and though you can rain wrath precisely like a god, you also need to pace yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The best kind of a Warrior is a Laughing Philosopher,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;not a Berserker (that&amp;apos;s too easy), be an Artist.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;It is a huge part of the art of living,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;to quit blaming yourself for being angry, or clumsy, or never finishing anything you start, or never finding the right person.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;You are not angry, there is nothing wrong with you,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you just took on so much weight and made so many compromises that there is no more time left for you to be yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I know it sounds awful when I say something as simple and go ride a bicycle, or a horse,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;or give the campsite raccoons so much anxiety that they start clawing their way into nice people&amp;apos;s backpacks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;But that is how it works, the way out of fog of war,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;must be simple so that you have no trouble taking it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;No one is asking you to drop out of school permanently,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you&amp;apos;re not going to be homeless, you will find a better job.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;You only need to say the truth to your next employer,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;your mental health, and your joy of life, and a balanced existence is critical to a healthy existence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Just because someone can lay down their life to meet a deadline whilst kissing ass and never asking for a raise,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it does not mean anybody healthy will ever try.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;If principals or teachers, or management or anything gets crazy on you,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;don&amp;apos;t quit, just don&amp;apos;t comply because doing so will hurt you, just take a vacation, because your mental and physical health is more important than anything else, period.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;If you are still not hearing this, if you are still not ready not to sacrifice yourself,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;let me say this, there is a lot of people out there who like that Mighty Teenager do have a breaking point that will scare the bajezus out of a shrink, who is only too happy to prescribe something.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Your self-compassion, your dignity, your beauty,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and the power that your laughter, your foolishness, your silliness, your mischievousness, and above all your giggles exert on the universe that surrounds you is to important to us all for you to keep walking a path that is hurting you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;You are irreplaceable, and when you rise, and choose to share your stories,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you will build roads for others to follow.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;By not putting up with what is hurting you,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you make the Universe a better place by becoming a beacon of sanity for those who will hear of your adventures.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Returning to school or job with with this dignity and integrity of mind,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;will change the way people treat you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Not just your confidence, but your wisdom, and strength, and balance,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;will alter your body language.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Stressed people and relaxed people, give off different behavioral clues,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;people including those in charge of budgets can read that very easily.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Terrible people who lack compassion are everywhere,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;sometimes stressed out people will be abused with more stress just because they keep taking it on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Things get supremely complicated,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;in ways that we can&amp;apos;t always understand.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;For example the reason why someone loses their 4.0 may have nothing to do with their performance,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but with the teacher giving out too many A/s in the previous semester, and now just trying to average things out with the people who never complain, so that the dean doesn&amp;apos;t come around complaining that his class sticks out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;apos;t matter if it is High School, or College, or what used to be a Dream Job,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;there are unethical fake it until you make it people covering their asses everywhere, it is a tragedy that someone like that should become a reason behind someone&amp;apos;s years of suffering.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;These are simple examples I am making up,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;in real life, there is no understanding of all the motives as people who never grew up, constantly interact with each other to to do less, and get more,&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Trouble-making is just a lighthearted way of leaving all that noise behind,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and regaining your own beauty, and strengths, and awe for the world around you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Give yourself some trouble that actually makes you better for a change.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;if the path you re walking on feels wrong, you need to begin preparing an adventure backpack.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A very special Monday is coming around,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;your clock will go off just like always.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;But this time it will die with a sad whimper as you - slowly and deliberately - unplug it from the wall,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and return to sleep, not worried about your deadline, job or school, but simply knowing full well, that they don&amp;apos;t matter anymore; because your well being is infinitely more important.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Then get into your car, or on a bus, and set a direction for sunny weather,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;drive, fly, just go, and do not wait to create your rules of adventure, do it as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;When your health returns to you,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you&amp;apos;ll know exactly where you are going, and schools will always take you back, and jobs that hurt you are now worthy of your concern at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Don&amp;apos;t make plans about the rest of your life until you catch up where you need to be and become wiser as think things through.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And finally, if you don&amp;apos;t like the idea of trouble making,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;then between You and I let us call it: Love of Life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&#34;,

             <p class="card-text small">The best kind of trouble is the trouble you create for yourself,
there is no limit to how elaborate of a problem you can invent.

Relativity and contrast play a very important role here,
the lower you are and the higher you aim the more it is worth the trouble.

It is safe to say that a nice and comfortable bed with an electric blanket,
on a quiet and sleepy afternoon is a pretty good low.

A pretty good height to reach is either ten miles by foot,
or 1,500 miles by car where it usually involves a beach...</p>

things,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;truth, authenticity, and a healthy existence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A beautiful life,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;requires our full beauty.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;To bloom, to truly grow up,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;we need to be truly free, we need to reside in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;It is not as easy as it sounds,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;though we all have the ability to set ourselves free from childhood indoctrination.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;What about, the less obvious things?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Such as doing badly on a test some years ago, having your GPA permanently lowered because of it,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but on the day of graduation, actually being able to perfectly pass that test, but now during graduation it being too late.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;So you are accepting a lower GPA, so that you can graduate sooner?&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that is not how reality works, and what about the extra motivation that you would receive from keeping a 4.0 GPA throughout your entire stay?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And what about the quality of that test,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and what about the people that passed it because they memorized it without really learning anything?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And what about the fact that that many will never need what was on that test,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;in effect the College or University slowing their progress down, distracting them from learning what would help them become more of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And what about well connected and ingratiated liars, at the company you do end up working at,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;what if after years of tests and textbooks and frightening and stressful debt, a liar dislikes you?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Reality, will make you strong and beautiful, it will make your life meaningful and full of joy,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but you have to keep it real, the education must be real, your place of employment must be stable and honest.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;At no point should you be pushed to the side,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and forced to walk a path that is different from who you are.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And do not forget, that we are granted a set amount of time,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;spending more than 30 years in pursuit of school and career that isn&amp;apos;t guaranteed to be what you need, should be a tough proposition.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Now, a real education coupled with a series of business undertakings that you learn from,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and eventual launch of a successful company based on what you have learned is a lot more stable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;So, High School, College, University and a Career,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;does not hold the same guarantee that Self Education and eventually becoming a Successful Founder, does.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;If you start leaning towards the Start-up Culture in High School,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you can start building your companies a lot sooner, and begin isolating and mastering the lessons that you actually need in the right sequence and at the right pace.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Just for the fact that there are no bullies when you learn on your own,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and zero pressure to memorize, and zero classes that will only distract you from learning what you need, self education is better for your mental health and growing up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Cults and religions are not the only indoctrination,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;they are just the ones that are trivial to catch.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A Real University, would only feature Great Thinkers, Great Actors and Narrators,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but even so, their beautiful performances, though eye catching, would never be as perfectly fitted to you as a series of fine hand-picked audio books.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Even an imaginary perfect-university, cannot match the power of a collection of audio books that you can listen and re-listen stress free,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;as you learn to build you companies and graduate to be able to grasp more and more complex subjects.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Lets just face it, being placed in a situation where you must merely memorize things,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is a sign that you are being taken advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Learning is not about memorization,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and memorization has nothing to do with learning.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Memorization is best used in poetry,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it a way to give thanks to poets.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Even if you memorize numbers of a new language,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;all you have left is a piece of information that is not yet useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Memorizing 100 of the most popular words in a language you are learning,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is almost dangerous as you will have trouble with correct pronunciation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;To learn a new language, you are best to create a path you can navigate and expand,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;watch a movie you are already familiar with in your native language, and build a transcript.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We are good at language,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;just like we are good at dance, don&amp;apos;t force it, love it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Your Knowledge is sacred,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it empowers your decision making, and helps your dreams come true.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;When someone barges in forcing you to heartlessly memorize things,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you must become very suspicious of their motives.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The world is poor, there are slick talking people out there with all kinds of issues,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;sometimes they are deans, principals, teachers, and even parents.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;You have to find a way to learn things right,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I think we all know, that way, is not the school way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I know you are scared, bad grades, yelling parents, threat of poverty and homelessness,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but you see, that won&amp;apos;t go away when you graduate by cramming, you are only delaying it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Moreover, by not becoming educated as soon as you can,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you become vulnerable to slick talking attackers, and shitty boyfriends.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;It is damn hard to catch a liar, so hard that we can almost assume that liars always do win,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it is because in their sickens they learn to exploit our cognitive biases.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The way to push back against manipulators,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is to become smarter than they are, and believe you me, this barely takes any effort at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;At most, AT MOST, 25 five audio books about modern life,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;though they must all have a positive ending, they have to be happy books.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;25 audio books is like a month of your life,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and, and, and if I may, it will be one of the most beautiful times of your life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;You will always return to where you were as you read them,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;so you better go to a nice place, or get in your car get on the longest highway and drive.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;You can either start your life with a heart break,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;or with adventure and audio books.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Grab your friends, tell them to behave,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and go together.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;If I may make a suggestion, lease stop at every antique store,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;as neat as the knickknacks are going to be, look for the most worn out books.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I found a saintly copy of Robinson Crusoe,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it fits in my back pocket so perfectly, I can&amp;apos;t even.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Look for Jack London, Herman Melville, Daniel Defoe,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and keep an eye out for works by Friedrich Nietzsche.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Use the paper versions to practice narration, but listen to the audio books,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;they are often out on Librivox.org for free as most of the classics are in public domain.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;That is all you need, to create an adventure,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;a path to somewhere far that hits as many antique stores as you can drive by.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And promise to drive carefully,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you are not in a hurry.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Now, not everyone is ready to write,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but some of you are a lot further along than you think.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Begin by writing a singe compound sentence at a time,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and that&amp;apos;s it, don&amp;apos;t press, flow.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Just like dehydration happens, or we sometimes develop vitamin deficiencies,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and need to pay extra attention to what we put in our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;My friends, same goes for our minds,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;fear or anxiety will cause you harm, you are not to live in fear of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Do you know what the symptoms of anxiety are?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Impatience, snapping at small things, thinning hair, wanting to be alone,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;sadness, brain fog, body aches, fatigue, bad sleep habits.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;These are not things that we can fix, you can&amp;apos;t take pain killers for body aches from from fear.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;By calling it adventure, I give you a simple choice to make,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but it is more than a simple adventure, I am inviting you on a quest away from the toxic sludge of an unexamined life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;In a way, psychology is a young science,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it is also the most humble and loving of all the Daughters of Philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;There aren&amp;apos;t too many answers here,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but there is something, and I can fit it in a sentence for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The secret to a long and healthy life is:&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Happiness.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I am asking you to move away from fear and other disorders that create countless issues,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and get on a path towards happiness, because that is a very powerful medicine.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Happiness is quite a thing,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it is almost on par with wisdom, though I suppose it the end it is one and the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Where wisdom makes you a beautiful writer,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;happiness makes you a powerful doctor.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The low key sarcastic, low brow, poker face, dead pan nonsense,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that will feature in your journals due to Happiness and Love of Life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Has the power to bring the most boorish and scared person from the brink of death,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and plop them in the middle of the Shenandoah Valley, walking stick in one hand and a bewildered companion in the other.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I once wondered how we could describe the most powerful beings on earth,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and somehow I came up with a two word description that still frightens-me-a-little to this day:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The Laughing Philosopher.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;While, I guess, I am not a real doctor, though the results are not quite in yet,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I am certain that even those who are deeply sad will find something that will bring them a special kind of Happiness when out on an adventure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And I would argue, that the saddest of us, are the least likely to be eaten by a bobcat,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;or dragged away by a condor.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And I know for certain, that the saddest of us,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;are the ones that eventually tell the happiest and most triumphant of stories.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;All you need to do, is be aware of the terrible fact,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that the first few days of your adventure will feel wrong; you have to snarl through it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Fight the urge to turn the car around,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that is just the toxic sludge within you fighting for survival, make sure it loses the battle.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;It will only take a few days,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and then, everything changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Oh my, when you get out of your car,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and your hiking or trail running shoes hit the gravel, it is like hearing bells of kissing a hundred woodland faeries.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;By taking that first detoxified step of your new adventure away from lies, bullies, limits and fears,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you can perfectly understand why dogs get zoomies sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And hearing your first chipmunk,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;will absolutely put all the damn birds to shame.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;No job, or school, or employer, or alarm clock with a creepy snooze button, or any damn thing,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;has any right to your joy of life - do you hear me?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;You joy of life is sacred,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;everything else has to be secondary.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;You are at your most beautiful, and you contribute to the world the most,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;when you are Happy, and occasionally mischievous.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Call it an adventure, or intellectual hygiene,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but keep your backpack by the door, and may you be always ready, for the call of the wild.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Because that will mark the rise of your own personal University,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and the beginning of your quest for real education and wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&#34;,

our minds require Beauty and Calm to learn the most at their best.

Haste of organized education, threats of losing a 4.0 GPA,
homework deadlines, and even subconsciously knowing that memorization is not education, will conspire against us.

Learning for real, real education, useful knowledge,
thriving wisdom, and eventual greatness demands a beautiful and authentic existence.

is,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;eventually, given enough time, and space, it emerges out of mere chaos and accident.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;When you look around this planet,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;despite lateral gene transfer, unstoppable power of selection, we are the only branch that can reach wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I think it is safe to say that some animals love and care, maybe admire,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but unfortunately try as they might Chimpanzees, Dolphins and Elephants can&amp;apos;t build cities of thoughts and dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;In a word, we, the emergent intelligent creatures, are:&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;rare.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;In two words:&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Beautiful and Rare.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We have to examine what sets us apart from Chimpanzees ad Dolphins,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and see what we can weave with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;In the misery of cold caves,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;or the torture or concentration camps imagining gods goes a long way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;In the dark ages of child labor,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;or the sickness of slavery and inequality school goes a long way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;In the age of Mustard Gas,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;or poverty and disease and hungry rats, a national border goes far.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;In the age of Mutually Assured Destruction,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Cold War and Global Threats, a University education can be useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;But in the age of Internet, we enter a new era,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;where what imaginary gods, simple schools, crazy borders, and trendy universities bring us, is actually, unimpressive and clunky.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We grew,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;my friends, it happened just now, just like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A new way of learning:&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Audio Books on The Trail.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;No university lecture,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;can beat twelve beloved and world celebrated books on the same subject.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Unlike Professors, books will bring you many a message, that you will discover between the lines,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;or in the lines of a companion memoir or biography.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A professor will teach you Nuclear Physics,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but he cannot teach you the Love necessary not to participate in weapons research.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A memoir,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;will.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;All the great books are connected, in the library books on weapons development will be connected to books about suffering in war,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;to books about the promise of World Peace...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And if not, then the Librarian will catch you with her smile, before you fall,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;by contrast a Professor&amp;apos;s smile is meaningless, if not fake.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Professors can only interfere with your development,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;no single university covers enough subjects to satisfy you, but a library does.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;While your Knowledge is a sure path to Wisdom,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;there is something else, you need.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;You need a taste of Greatness,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you will never find it in a University town, never.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;There is but a handful of places on earth that will help you feel it,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;those are the months long hiking trails found on each continent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;When you connect the triumph of adapting to the hardships of a trail,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;in rain in snow...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;...to the inheritance of wisdom from books,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I am sorry to say, that the first thing you will feel is a brief flash rage and tears.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;For how could the Good World and the Professors you once respected betray you,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;by putting you into a little dorm room.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And no lecture hall is big enough, or prestigious enough,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;to impress you more than the stars, and the silence, and fragrance of woods.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;How could an old and experienced Professor teach you poetry, better,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;than your beating heart, on the eve of your first encounter with a Bear, and her cubs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;No professor could ever reach as deep into your heart,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;as a book of inspirational verse, on that stormy night that you should have stayed in the valley below.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And the Greatness of a simple warm morning filled with the fragrance of pine trees with a hint of last evening&amp;apos;s bonfire,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that thick moist air, as you hand spiritually pushes straight through each page of paper book that you now comprehend better than the author, the day he finished.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;He wrote as a mail sorter, or cast away, or patent clerk, or a star crossed overman,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but you read it, as an Emergent Masterpiece of The Universe, a Complete Human Being.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Let the trail,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;become your semesters and diplomas and awards, and the returns to it, you never-ending graduation ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;SPEAK OUT,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;do not let the others live unaware that Universities in their mediocrity have fallen to Nature Trails and Audio Books.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;SPEAK OUT,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;do not let other students aim for a job, their job is to build companies, onwards to becoming Great Leaders.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;SPEAK OUT,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;tell them about your rage and tears of being denied a real education that fits you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Speak Out,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;speak out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;In wisdom, and in certainty of knowing that your path is the correct path,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it is the path of real results, Wisdom, and Greatness.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The Trail,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and that thread, are one and the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And the grades, every one of your grades will far surpass any and all scales,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;in cold rain, in snow too deep to traverse, in hunger two days out from the next town, upon your arrival you rise to a new height, that no grade can mark.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;After a few years,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;what you have weaved out of your books, will be unbreakable, and so unique as to extend precisely who yo are, far into, who you must become to reach greatness.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A day will come, when you will notice the struggle of authors to rise higher,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and in sadness discover that you will find fewer and fewer books that move you, eventually where your last book ends.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Your own book,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;will start.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And you will add to the mountain peak you climbed,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and others will follow, and your book will become their last book, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;That&amp;apos;s how you will know what is real,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;what is fake, by taking every important step to the highest of heights and leaving your Soul behind for others to resurrect it when your book comes up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Worry not, countless others have traveled these roads,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;wisdom is real, it is meaningful, it changes you and others for better, and your book will be irreplaceable and beloved by many.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And, no, it is foolish to think that you must become an author to write a book, there are too many of those books already,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you only need to become wise to write, there are no critics here, as you cry, the reader will cry, as you climb the next mountain, the reader will triumph with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Take your self-education to the trails,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;the nature will help you slow down and connect with the spirits of the authors stored within the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Don&amp;apos;t worry, it will be OK,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;so as long as all your steps count as a triumph, your growing up will become an upward slope, and your life will eventually become as beautiful as you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And the last thing a Great Being discovers,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is the answer to their first big question &amp;quot;Who am I?&amp;quot;, it will all lay open as you look back from your golden age.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Your path to wisdom intertwined with adventure and great discoveries,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and bears, and dunes, and Fox Fire, and rain and snow, and softness of moss, and endless seas of fern, open like all the great ideas behind all the most beloved of poems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&#34;,

how can you tell which of these are real, outdated or just not worth your time?

By finding your beginning, of course,
and then weaving an unbroken thread that makes you rise.

We are born of chaos and accident, but we are a masterpiece of the Universe,
the time required to permute all combinations of chemicals to give rise to life is, long.

We are here, because as unlikely as life is,

wanting to be done with this dumb kid stuff and have Ice Cream... even in winter.

Just being half pint is not that big of a deal,
it is the not knowing, what adults know, that&#39;s the hard part.

For some of us this is a book, or a manual, or the mystery of philosophy,
but what we are actually trying to picture is... Wisdom.

Even as babies we know that wisdom separates a child from an adult,
it isn&#39;t just about growing older, anybody can just age, it is...</p>

imagine two wise beings from nations that dislike each other.

There is nothing but admiration,

there is a lot those two have to say to each other.

One dreams about rebuilding the United States,
