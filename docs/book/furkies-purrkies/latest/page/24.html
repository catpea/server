Not only are we unable to directly conjure up the greatest of our heights,
in that they must ensue from our Greatness &amp; Pursuits.

But also,
we can&#39;t see that which we will miss.

A mistake hidden within the heartbreaking realm of never knowing what we missed,
an old, odd realm, strangely built with invisible walls.

The only way we can be sure that we have not fallen to some prison of invisible walls,
is to keep moving forward and up, and never stop.

If our elder selves, do end up, having...</p>

             <p class="card-text small">I know all too well that writing books is hard,
as far as I can tell; I am still learning English.

But books, share principles, with life,
be it book or life, it is always page after page, it has chapters.

Books are not, some fancy extra,
but a pretty fancy way of rising, just rising.

And perhaps it is somewhat old fashioned to be urging you to write books,
but I don&#39;t feel bad at all.

I expect the first one is the hardest,
the second one will be shoooo goood,

The third one - I am sorry,

I doubt that such pain makes us &amp;#x2018;better&amp;#x2019;; but I know that it makes us more profound.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;(Thanks Friedrich, My Dear Old Friend.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Albert Camus brings it down to reality,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;speaking of accepting that life comes with Difficulty and Ease, and we should accept both.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A will to live without rejecting anything of life... is the virtue I honor most in this world.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;It is not enough to learn &lt;strong&gt;about&lt;/strong&gt; a philosophical concept like we just did,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;we should hope to integrate it, or keep it as a reminder that we have more to learn before we understand it fully.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The way I connect with Amor Fati,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is by understanding that not everything in my life will happen for a reason,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;some thing will just happen out of complexity and randomness that we can&amp;apos;t prevent; and that to me is fate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I like how Albert Camus telks about Ease and Difficulty and the way I understand him,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is that we should stand up for what we believe in, even if it means that people will yell at us.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;So it is not tolerance of difficult things that just happen for no reason,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but the difficulty of standing up for what we believe in when the chance presents it self, for no reason- you see.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Our decision making which dictates our path in life,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;has nothing to do with things that happen for no reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Finally, Amor Fati simply means,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;do not let things that you have no control over take away from your Love of Life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;While this may not be exactly what Friedrich Nietzsche and Albert Camus talk about,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;my initial, more personal interpretation, gives me a platform from which I can learn both of their interpretations and mutual differences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And what I am showing here, is that we don&amp;apos;t have to understand all the philosophical concepts right away,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that it is best to learn a little bit at a time, at our own pace, and in our own sequence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&#34;,

             <p class="card-text small">The Philosophers attempt to bring ideas to the future generations,
they are masters of learning how to think, conceptualize, and get extremely smart.

There are a few things that we must set aside at first,
and above all remember that they were children once, teenagers, that they are all too human.

When possible we should begin with survey courses and general overviews,
Video Lectures and Audio Books on the subject of Philosophy in general.

is a great start, Ariel and Will Durant seem like an amazing...</p>

             <p class="card-text small">We are all very unique,
and we are irreplaceable.

But the world is still growing,
and it may neither fit not truly inspire you.

So you have to find out what really moves you,
what makes you stand on unshakable ground.

Accepting the responsibility for your own education,
you must become authentic and unbreakable.

You have to find what inspires you,
and carry on, on that path.

Grow and develop and alter your course as fits you best,
but make sure that each day adds to the previous.

Do not alter...</p>

             <p class="card-text small">It has been happening slowly for a hundred years,
even though people are not taught to become Great Beings.

Mistakes, especially the ones that make us feel foolish,
open out minds for rapid self education.

It used to be harder to learn,
now we have Audiobooks and video lectures.

It is a very big difference between finding Thoreau&#39;s Walden,
and having a Writer or a Professor take you on a tour of modern philosophy.

I think the ability to pause a lecture or an audio book is amazing,
I paused as often...</p>
