the roads there are obscured by confused and confusing chatter.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;It is not until we accept the responsibility for our own education,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that we will start learning, for real.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The biggest mistake is borders,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;groups of wealthy uneducated people coming together to decide the futures of their nations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;These men claim greatness,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and hold up their experience as their proof.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;But experience is no substitute for wisdom,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;on the surface experience makes a person indistinguishable from a wise one.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The first clue to distinguish the two, is found in length of vision,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;when they get around to speaking of problems of today, they will give excuses that they know - from experience - will hold up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;But they will dismiss the future entirely,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;because to speak of the future; a person needs a direction, a vision, an objective, a purpose, a wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Men of experience, are too small minded, too blind and limited, to shallow, to fragile,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;to see into things that have no impact on them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Our levels of education are insufficient to directly address the problems that we face today,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;there are too few well educated, knowledgeable and wise beings to repair anything right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;An uneducated voting majority is all to easily swayed and misled,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and our poverty will prevent our generation from re-learning.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;One of the worst things about general poverty,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is that it induces a poverty of mind, out of lack of time, out of stress, fear, and discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Reality, has no borders, as climate change and pandemics show us,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;in reality we are one human family.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And in reality, poverty is tearing the world apart,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it is keeping us weak.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;In reality, a teenager in a dictatorship on the other side of the world,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is your friend, they would love you if you sent them popular snacks from your city, some photos and music.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;They are family,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;there are people out there who would be genuinely kinder to you than some of your own family.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;It is sooooo sad that we label each other with the names of our nations,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and return to tend to whatever poverty we are facing at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Internet, student exchange, programs like Peace Corps,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and documents like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights help us see in our confused state.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;But it is just a tiny sliver of light,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;poverty of mind alone is almost unaffected by it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;United Nations has its hands tied,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;without an appropriate level of education General Assembly will stand in a constant state of disagreement.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Without a plan to unite, and eliminate poverty,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;we are all equally wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And we can&amp;apos;t have Unity and Prosperity without Knowledge and Wisdom,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;liars would instantly invent something that they stand to lose, and tear the world right up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Do you hear me, do you see what I am saying,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;we are one, it is all of us, or none.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The way to fix it,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is by inventing educational programs that really help children to knowledge, wisdom and greatness.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Because until we hold long term visions fueled by Knowledge and Wisdom,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;the only thing we can agree on, is what the liars want us to believe in.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Real education is the thing that leads us to have thoughts independent to what is on TV and in News Papers,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it helps us see who the liars, and mark my words for this sorry year, even when they assume a pleasing shape.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Real Education grants us Intellectual Independence,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;where audio book by book we all independently gain a valid grasp on reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Organized education will always bend under the threat of being defunded or kept in poverty,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it will help to invent brand name institutions that are only better in the name, but all equally ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Organized education will rip talent out of children, it will sand it down until they are all equally lost,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;mixed with poverty most parents won&amp;apos;t even be granted the ability to care about what is happening to the minds of their children, because the babysitting is good.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Organized education ends up causing harm to children&amp;apos;s intellectual development,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it holds them back and causes so much stress that it is impossible to learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Organized education is such a problem, that even the best minds of our generations,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;are still thinking about &amp;quot;Free College&amp;quot; - about paying those fraudulent institutions - instead of funding ones that are capable of Real Education.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Things are pretty bad, thankfully, we are infinite in our capacity to deal with real dangers,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;especially the ones that tear tear our family apart.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Real education is based on students&amp;apos; predispositions,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and curiosities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;For example, when someone is interested in the moon or stars at night,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that marks an entry point into Science Fiction, Astrophysics, Astrography and if they continue to care, Optics, Mathematics, Physics, Writing and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Most children won&amp;apos;t care for stars very long, because they are interested in exploring all of the universe,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and that is even better because then there is a multitude of passage ways they can use to walk through the sciences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;But it has to be their own walking, their own direction, and at their own pace,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;we have to honor their predispositions and curiosities, the students are the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We have to remove grades, tests, graduation, class rooms, time divisions, subject divisions, rows of seats, groupings of any kind be it age or area of study,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;we have to replace the teacher with personalized learning and tutors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And we have to give the students what they need, a telescope, a fast single board computer with all the sensors and servos they could ever need,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;they need the ability to launch satellites, to operate small remotely operated submarines and small drones, they need access to things they are curious about.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;If a student is walking the wrong path, then it is a path that has been been walked many times before, they are asking a question, and they need powerful answers,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;they have to see what war is like, what prisons are like, what concentration camps are like - and what love is like - and they will learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;At the time of writing this in 2020, I realized that there are three nations that operate concentrations camps,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;which is probably to say, that there are many; and they need to see that too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;They need to see gang violence, and if they are still around then meet up with Father Gregory Boyle&amp;apos;s boys,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;for they have surely become Great Beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Nothing goes wrong in real education,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;real education is about reality, about really growing up, and really being human.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And when these students grow up, become voters, Senators and Congresswomen and Congressmen,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;then the liars, and pretenders, will lose their hold on humanity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And then the members of General Assembly of United nations,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;can finally have their day, in agreement and unity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;My friends,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;never lose hope.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;If something important can&amp;apos;t happen today,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it only means that you are to begin building the bridge, for others to eventually get there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Real Education is the first step,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;the second is actually many overlapping steps that will happen all at once, all around the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;What you have to do is make sure that the students get to own or hold in their own hands the many tools that they need,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;to learn, and explore the Human Condition, and The Sciences, and The World, and The Stars; as those are their countless bookmarks and the steppingstones to their boundless steps.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The children want to learn,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and that is all the hope Humanity will ever need.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&#34;,

             <p class="card-text small">Mistakes and Misunderstandings divide Humanity today,
noting can be done because varying levels of education interfere with unity.

One of the biggest mistakes is ineffective education
tricking students into believing that they are educated.

Mis-education, fake education, ineffective education makes us blind,
truths and facts are drowned in an ocean of conflicting and equally wrong opinions.

Real education, is the key to unity, to a common grasp on reality,
but all the roads there are obscured by...</p>

growth,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;increased cognition, enhanced instinct, and out limitless and ever enlarging body of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A poetic way of describing predispositions,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is a compass with a finely tuned needle.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Though rare, sometimes predispositions are about negative experiences,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;for example being smittened by all the things the Army Recruiter lies about at the Mall.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Underestimating the beautiful Appalachian or Pacific Crest Trails, is another example,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it is better to section hike a little bit at first, some take many years to section hike the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;But you know, as our horizon enlarges, even a tepid military experience can translate to greatness,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;working with governments to protect endangered species from dangerous poachers is one beautiful example.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Following our compass, and expanding our endless horizons will transform us,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;our predispositions will bloom like fields of wildflowers, colorful, unstoppable, unbreakable, endless.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And here I must state, in no uncertain terms, that I believe that,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;following a compass needle that is set by somebody or something else, will deeply hurt us, send us into sadness and regret.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We all start with a tiny and wobbly compass,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and the littlest of horizons.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Perhaps a penchant for disassembling favorite toys, and an impeccable library of all the outstanding places that are somehow unusual,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;from a cracked spider web filled WWII bunker to every river bridge that you can get under and get filthy from.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We have to cake care of who we are, and become more of it,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;because that expands our horizon in the most magnificent of ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The dusty bridges turn to dusty trails,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;toys become your endless computer programs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;You become an adventurer,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and an artist, and then so much more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I suspect, we will run out of road,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;if we follow an alien path.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;You are filled with gentle and unique predispositions,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that will bring you great wisdom when examined.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Until you do follow your dreams and arrive at all the shores that call to you,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you won&amp;apos;t really know what it is that you will become capable of, but it will be something far greater than you can image.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A great horizon, a great library of knowledge that helps you reason about new things by subtle analogy to what you already know,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;takes you beyond one word guesses of wishes like lawyer, soldier, or doctor, in to the world of Presidents and Prime Ministers, Peace Makers, and Scientists that further Human Kind.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And if it so turns out that the world is not yet ready for who you become,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;then you become a part of a bridge that aims to cover that gap, or restore something that has gone lost.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A President that the world is not yet ready to elect will work to help the world grow, a Peace Maker will aim to remind the world we are one,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;a Scientist that does not yet have the necessary tools and research, will work to invent them for those that are sure follow.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We must listen to our hearts, to our curiosities and learn to no end, look how much more you are than the child you once were,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that child could not have grasped the complexity of your being today, and you today, cannot grasp the complexity and beauty of your wisest self... keep learning, and keep following your own dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&#34;,

is just as good,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;spending half a year traveling the Appalachian Trail is the most powerful example.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Above all, going to sleep when it gets dark, and rising to watch the sun rise,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is a great treasure, that brings great heath and strength.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Going forward every day, and slowing down to match the pace of nature,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;helps people have long thoughts and connects all their dots together.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Discomfort, is not part of learning and growing, or healing,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it is just that we must not succumb to fear and imaginary dragons.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Doing new things is not perfect, but it is not discomfort,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;discomfort is when someone is hurting you, or life is crushing you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;These are the situations that require drastic changes,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;not just a set of changes, but a long term series of changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Some people, presumably at-least armchair psychologists,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;say that we end up using a more logical side of our brain...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;But, I am sure that our brains are infinitely more complex than that,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and what is actually going on is that we are leaving a kind of depression behind.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;One of our main missions in life, is to live it to its fullest because, life is precious,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and that includes living in balance with nature, wisdom, and universe.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And while, I do admit that this sounds a wee bit hokey,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;the best way to personally explore ideas behind heath and balance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Is to try to imagine our elder selves,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;at say, 85 and a half years, young.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;It is hard to deny that, no one is more connected to the elder you, than you right now,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you can try to project your predispositions and try to imagine what the elder you is like.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Our energy is found in balanced living,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;we have to move away from stress, and depression, and overwork.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Our intelligence, and creativity, our memory, and ability to learn, and read books,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;requires that we take really good care of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;In school and at work, you will find your self facing,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;what I would call Profit Optimization.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Mediocre teachers will want a perfect mediocre score,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that is slightly above their last year statistics so that they may show improvement.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The average employer will want you to do more for less,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;or to get more out of you, without investing more into you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And that means,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;pushing you past your healthy balance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Encouraging use of medications that help with temporary memory at school,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and whatever pushes you into overwork and over performing at work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;apos;t do that,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you will be replaced by someone who is willing to live sick for the minimum you got paid, or less.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Allow me to digress, and say that to deal with both of these issues in a healthy fashion,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you can self-educate and and aim to build a serious of start-ups.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Now, when building your companies, you will be tasked with not pushing yourself,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;while it is easier to overwork in short term, it is not worth it in long term.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;You need heart, and soul, and long visions and thoughts to craft your own future,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and being stressed, depressed, and overworked will only take those powers away from you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Living healthy should be the easiest thing for you, cramming, overworking, stressing, depressing,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and squeezing every last bit of energy out of yourself, aught to be the more difficult path.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Just listen to what I am saying;&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;when you are healthy and in balance with your self, or with nature, whatever you conceive to be:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;You are at your most intelligent, and most creative, and strongest self,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you are also most beautiful, and I am sure at your funniest, in that worst of ways where no one is sure if are joking or dead serious.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;One of the ways to connect with your elder self,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is to make them better, is to grant them outrageous gifts from your youth.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Even if just to remind them,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;who the boss really is, or to make them smile in wonder.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Great beings often appear slightly odd and confusingly funny, just because of that,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;they are sending a message into their own future, to guarantee the health of their elder selves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Culture switching helps a person become unstuck,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it exposes them to new experiences, and removes old discomforts, and often making them more courageous.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;It is important to read books, and that means to live in a state that is conducive to inheriting lifetimes of knowledge,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and that state just can&amp;apos;t be found at places that aim to push you out of balance for their own profit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;It sounds terrible, but this is just a call to rising, to self balancing, to becoming an independent thinker,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;to leaving all influences whether perceptible of obscured, behind you, in a blur of a series of challenges.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;With each new step,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you will learn new things.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;With each new culture,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you will become more illuminated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And with each Great Endeavor,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you will become, greater.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&#34;,

The point is not to be glued to a single spot,

because the world belongs to you.

Too many problems come from fantasies,
there are too many of them to mention.

So many of them are so miserable,
that no poem can hold them.

We can only really rise,
high and above anything and everything.

We can only really make real decisions,
once we have a good view of the world.

Until we are certain that we aren&#39;t under some influence,
we can&#39;t be certain that our decisions are entirely our own.

Great battles come to all of...</p>

&lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Organized and mandatory education is a recent invention,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it works up to middle school where teachers begin hiding inexperience behind abstractions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;When teaching a class of multiple students there is only time for lowest common denominators,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;everything gets hurried along and those who can&amp;apos;t understand something begin memorizing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Within a few years everyone is temporarily memorizing everything to be sure they graduate,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;those who try to learn, are graded down under the threat of being held back and repeating the year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Nobody is learning anything useful, everyone is memorizing,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and teachers, grades, and threats of being held back only reinforce memorization.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;That is not education,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that is memorization,

based curricula would grow the same way the world encyclopedia did,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;a little bit at a time, from all directions, as students are rewarded for following their curiosities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I write this in year 2020 when it seems that all our old mistakes have reemerged,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but what is actually going on is that mis-educated people are self assembling into desperate groups.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We are seeing groups self-reinforcing each other&amp;apos;s beliefs based on color of skin,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;they come together to form communities because of an imaginary superiority a color.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We have a nation that treats women with he permanent legal status of a minor,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;of someone who is less than 18 years old, and politicians do not know to become enraged by this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We have two nations that feature concentration camps,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and the Land of the Free that practices torture under the guise of enhanced interrogation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;All of this is happening because of failure of schooling,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;inability of politicians to build.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Now, let me close with a heart warming thought experiment,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;which deep down I hope some magnificent nation a thousand years in the future may try for real.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We can all agree that, education is an investment in a nation&amp;apos;s future,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and that pretending to teach children by forcing them into memorization can destroy a nation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Let us say that, in this thought experiment, unless a better program is in place,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;countries should pay their students for achievement, not with imaginary letters but with real money.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Students in elementary should be getting paid just as much money as college students,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and the amount that they bring home should be equal that of a prestigious job.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;After all what is more prestigious than the child&amp;apos;s real knowledge,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;a child will soon become a politician, investor, leader, and inspiration for others to follow.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Making some $200,000 a year in 2020 money, is an amazing way for a nation to show respect its students,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and it will proudly display how much more important they are in proportion to the defense budget.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Graduation, would leave a student not with crippling debt that can&amp;apos;t be erased with bankruptcy,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but with just about $3.2 million dollars in their account, that is how a graduate should start life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The cost of this is irrelevant, these are hundreds of trillions of dollars per year that simply add to our national debt,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;this is what it means to have a country.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;What we see today, is poverty, children going hungry, fake education, ineffective politics,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and research and legalization of dangerous drugs for the purpose of erasing stress, and PTSD born from poverty.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We cannot allow ourselves to live in the fantasy land,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;where it is OK for one nation to teach their children that another needs to be destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We cannot allow ourselves to live in the fantasy of a limited number of abstract virtual pieces of paper,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that sometimes make children die of starvation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Humanity, has outgrown the type of primitive small town thinking that we see today,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it has outgrown it probably more than a hundred years ago when large cities started growing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;For those of you who are still laughing at my though experiment,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;take a lesson from the way early internet social networks would reform themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Initially switching to more automated, more statistics and probability oriented systems,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;would set their platforms on fire and cause waves of disturbance, but that is how things adapt to growing larger.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Call it growing pains, call it Love of Humanity, call it a nation at a stand still,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;in process of not just erasing poverty but creating an overabundance of wealth for its students.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Out of Love and Wisdom,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;out of Greatness of Vision, and of yearning for other nations to follow onward to World Peace, Safety and Equality.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And my final words are a question, if you created a thought experiment that represented the sad state of affairs today,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;what would that thought experiment be about, and what would it be trying to prove?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&#34;,

in the context of the whole world, however, education is a path to World Peace.

Education is a very unusual thing,
it enhances everything it can touch.

To borrow from movies,
education is our loading program.

To borrow from computers,
education is our operating system.

Without education, we reset back to some 20,000 or 50,000 years ago,
we end up living in villages and inventing gods to help with harvest and...</p>
