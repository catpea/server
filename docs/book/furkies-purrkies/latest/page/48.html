growth,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;increased cognition, enhanced instinct, and out limitless and ever enlarging body of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A poetic way of describing predispositions,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is a compass with a finely tuned needle.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Though rare, sometimes predispositions are about negative experiences,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;for example being smittened by all the things the Army Recruiter lies about at the Mall.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Underestimating the beautiful Appalachian or Pacific Crest Trails, is another example,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it is better to section hike a little bit at first, some take many years to section hike the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;But you know, as our horizon enlarges, even a tepid military experience can translate to greatness,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;working with governments to protect endangered species from dangerous poachers is one beautiful example.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Following our compass, and expanding our endless horizons will transform us,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;our predispositions will bloom like fields of wildflowers, colorful, unstoppable, unbreakable, endless.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And here I must state, in no uncertain terms, that I believe that,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;following a compass needle that is set by somebody or something else, will deeply hurt us, send us into sadness and regret.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We all start with a tiny and wobbly compass,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and the littlest of horizons.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Perhaps a penchant for disassembling favorite toys, and an impeccable library of all the outstanding places that are somehow unusual,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;from a cracked spider web filled WWII bunker to every river bridge that you can get under and get filthy from.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We have to cake care of who we are, and become more of it,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;because that expands our horizon in the most magnificent of ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The dusty bridges turn to dusty trails,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;toys become your endless computer programs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;You become an adventurer,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and an artist, and then so much more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I suspect, we will run out of road,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;if we follow an alien path.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;You are filled with gentle and unique predispositions,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that will bring you great wisdom when examined.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Until you do follow your dreams and arrive at all the shores that call to you,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you won&amp;apos;t really know what it is that you will become capable of, but it will be something far greater than you can image.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A great horizon, a great library of knowledge that helps you reason about new things by subtle analogy to what you already know,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;takes you beyond one word guesses of wishes like lawyer, soldier, or doctor, in to the world of Presidents and Prime Ministers, Peace Makers, and Scientists that further Human Kind.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And if it so turns out that the world is not yet ready for who you become,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;then you become a part of a bridge that aims to cover that gap, or restore something that has gone lost.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A President that the world is not yet ready to elect will work to help the world grow, a Peace Maker will aim to remind the world we are one,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;a Scientist that does not yet have the necessary tools and research, will work to invent them for those that are sure follow.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We must listen to our hearts, to our curiosities and learn to no end, look how much more you are than the child you once were,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that child could not have grasped the complexity of your being today, and you today, cannot grasp the complexity and beauty of your wisest self... keep learning, and keep following your own dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&#34;,

Our predispositions, life experiences, existing knowledge, what we do and where we are,
our curiosities and triumphs as well as failures, choose what comes next.

The expansion of horizon is a poetic way of indicating growth,
increased cognition, enhanced instinct, and out limitless and ever enlarging body of knowledge.

is just as good,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;spending half a year traveling the Appalachian Trail is the most powerful example.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Above all, going to sleep when it gets dark, and rising to watch the sun rise,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is a great treasure, that brings great heath and strength.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Going forward every day, and slowing down to match the pace of nature,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;helps people have long thoughts and connects all their dots together.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Discomfort, is not part of learning and growing, or healing,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it is just that we must not succumb to fear and imaginary dragons.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Doing new things is not perfect, but it is not discomfort,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;discomfort is when someone is hurting you, or life is crushing you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;These are the situations that require drastic changes,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;not just a set of changes, but a long term series of changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Some people, presumably at-least armchair psychologists,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;say that we end up using a more logical side of our brain...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;But, I am sure that our brains are infinitely more complex than that,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and what is actually going on is that we are leaving a kind of depression behind.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;One of our main missions in life, is to live it to its fullest because, life is precious,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and that includes living in balance with nature, wisdom, and universe.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And while, I do admit that this sounds a wee bit hokey,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;the best way to personally explore ideas behind heath and balance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Is to try to imagine our elder selves,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;at say, 85 and a half years, young.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;It is hard to deny that, no one is more connected to the elder you, than you right now,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you can try to project your predispositions and try to imagine what the elder you is like.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Our energy is found in balanced living,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;we have to move away from stress, and depression, and overwork.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Our intelligence, and creativity, our memory, and ability to learn, and read books,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;requires that we take really good care of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;In school and at work, you will find your self facing,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;what I would call Profit Optimization.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Mediocre teachers will want a perfect mediocre score,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that is slightly above their last year statistics so that they may show improvement.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The average employer will want you to do more for less,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;or to get more out of you, without investing more into you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And that means,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;pushing you past your healthy balance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Encouraging use of medications that help with temporary memory at school,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and whatever pushes you into overwork and over performing at work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;apos;t do that,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you will be replaced by someone who is willing to live sick for the minimum you got paid, or less.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Allow me to digress, and say that to deal with both of these issues in a healthy fashion,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you can self-educate and and aim to build a serious of start-ups.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Now, when building your companies, you will be tasked with not pushing yourself,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;while it is easier to overwork in short term, it is not worth it in long term.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;You need heart, and soul, and long visions and thoughts to craft your own future,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and being stressed, depressed, and overworked will only take those powers away from you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Living healthy should be the easiest thing for you, cramming, overworking, stressing, depressing,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and squeezing every last bit of energy out of yourself, aught to be the more difficult path.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Just listen to what I am saying;&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;when you are healthy and in balance with your self, or with nature, whatever you conceive to be:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;You are at your most intelligent, and most creative, and strongest self,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;you are also most beautiful, and I am sure at your funniest, in that worst of ways where no one is sure if are joking or dead serious.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;One of the ways to connect with your elder self,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;is to make them better, is to grant them outrageous gifts from your

             <p class="card-text small">Culture switching is the best way to learn, it is about discovering that not only one&#39;s own culture is fluid,
but also, that there is no standard culture, just a colorful bouquet.

I think most people assume that switching cultures
means living in some other country for a but moving around is just as good.

The point is not to be glued to a single spot,

Too many problems come from fantasies,
there are too many of them to mention.

We can only really make real decisions,
once we have a good view of the world.

Until we are certain that we aren&#39;t under some influence,
we can&#39;t be certain that our decisions are entirely our own.

down,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it will be difficult to become wise, it may not be possible to become great.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Failure to propagate modern knowledge, seems to take the shape of,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;an uneducated majority, and a tiny educated minority without any voting power.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Once the failure of education takes hold,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;nothing can be done to fix the anomalies that occur afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The only way to help things along is to avoid the emergence of anomalies in the first place,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and that means having a functional educational system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;If it is not possible for a nation to teach its children,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;if the dream of organized, mandatory and standardized education is not realistic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Personalized computer based, self education must be put in its place,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;the transition can be made easy by transitioning from grades to money, credits, or bonds.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The initial computer based curricula would grow the same way the world encyclopedia did,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;a little bit at a time, from all directions, as students are rewarded for following their curiosities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;I write this in year 2020 when it seems that all our old mistakes have reemerged,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but what is actually going on is that mis-educated people are self assembling into desperate groups.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We are seeing groups self-reinforcing each other&amp;apos;s beliefs based on color of skin,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;they come together to form communities because of an imaginary superiority a color.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We have a nation that treats women with he permanent legal status of a minor,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;of someone who is less than 18 years old, and politicians do not know to become enraged by this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We have two nations that feature concentration camps,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and the Land of the Free that practices torture under the guise of enhanced interrogation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;All of this is happening because of failure of schooling,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;inability of politicians to build.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Now, let me close with a heart warming thought experiment,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;which deep down I hope some magnificent nation a thousand years in the future may try for real.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We can all agree that, education is an investment in a nation&amp;apos;s future,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and that pretending to teach children by forcing them into memorization can destroy a nation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Let us say that, in this thought experiment, unless a better program is in place,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;countries should pay their students for achievement, not with imaginary letters but with real money.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Students in elementary should be getting paid just as much money as college students,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and the amount that they bring home should be equal that of a prestigious job.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;After all what is more prestigious than the child&amp;apos;s real knowledge,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;a child will soon become a politician, investor, leader, and inspiration for others to follow.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Making some $200,000 a year in 2020 money, is an amazing way for a nation to show respect its students,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and it will proudly display how much more important they are in proportion to the defense budget.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Graduation, would leave a student not with crippling debt that can&amp;apos;t be erased with bankruptcy,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;but with just about $3.2 million dollars in their account, that is how a graduate should start life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The cost of this is irrelevant, these are hundreds of trillions of dollars per year that simply add to our national debt,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;this is what it means to have a country.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;What we see today, is poverty, children going hungry, fake education, ineffective politics,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;and research and legalization of dangerous drugs for the purpose of erasing stress, and PTSD born from poverty.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We cannot allow ourselves to live in the fantasy land,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;where it is OK for one nation to teach their children that another needs to be destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;We cannot allow ourselves to live in the fantasy of a limited number of abstract virtual pieces of paper,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;that sometimes make children die of starvation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Humanity, has outgrown the type of primitive small town thinking that we see today,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;it has outgrown it probably more than a hundred years ago when large cities started growing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;For those of you who are still laughing at my though experiment,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;take a lesson from the way early internet social networks would reform themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Initially switching to more automated, more statistics and probability oriented systems,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;would set their platforms on fire and cause waves of disturbance, but that is how things adapt to growing larger.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Call it growing pains, call it Love of Humanity, call it a nation at a stand still,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;in process of not just erasing poverty but creating an overabundance of wealth for its students.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Out of Love and Wisdom,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;out of Greatness of Vision, and of yearning for other nations to follow onward to World Peace, Safety and Equality.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And my final words are a question, if you created a thought experiment that represented the sad state of affairs today,&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;what would that thought experiment be about, and what would it be trying to prove?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;&#34;,

This is extremely easy, because avoidance of liars entails a path that they will never walk on,
liars will never walk on the path of Knowledge, Invention, Hard Earned Accomplishment, Wisdom, and Greatness.

One example of a good liar is that good old Wild Wild West snake oil salesman,
they were probably selling cheap sugar and cheap moonshine, because it was cheap to make and didn&#39;t cause much...</p>
