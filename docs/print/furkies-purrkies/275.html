      <div class="paragraph">Gnothi Seauton: An Old Kind Of School</div>
      <div class="paragraph"><small>Written Monday, November 30th 2020, 4:51:52 pm</small></div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">School, wisdom, philosophy, job, university, career, writing, politics, adventure, grades, greatness, soul,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">how can you tell which of these are real, outdated or just not worth your time?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">By finding your beginning, of course,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and then weaving an unbroken thread that makes you rise.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are born of chaos and accident, but we are a masterpiece of the Universe,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the time required to permute all combinations of chemicals to give rise to life is, long.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are here, because as unlikely as life is,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">eventually, given enough time, and space, it emerges out of mere chaos and accident.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When you look around this planet,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">despite lateral gene transfer, unstoppable power of selection, we are the only branch that can reach wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think it is safe to say that some animals love and care, maybe admire,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but unfortunately try as they might Chimpanzees, Dolphins and Elephants can't build cities of thoughts and dreams.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In a word, we, the emergent intelligent creatures, are:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">rare.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In two words:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Beautiful and Rare.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have to examine what sets us apart from Chimpanzees ad Dolphins,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and see what we can weave with it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In the misery of cold caves,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or the torture or concentration camps imagining gods goes a long way.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In the dark ages of child labor,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or the sickness of slavery and inequality school goes a long way.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In the age of Mustard Gas,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or poverty and disease and hungry rats, a national border goes far.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In the age of Mutually Assured Destruction,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Cold War and Global Threats, a University education can be useful.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But in the age of Internet, we enter a new era,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">where what imaginary gods, simple schools, crazy borders, and trendy universities bring us, is actually, unimpressive and clunky.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We grew,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">my friends, it happened just now, just like that.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A new way of learning:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Audio Books on The Trail.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No university lecture,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">can beat twelve beloved and world celebrated books on the same subject.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Unlike Professors, books will bring you many a message, that you will discover between the lines,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or in the lines of a companion memoir or biography.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A professor will teach you Nuclear Physics,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but he cannot teach you the Love necessary not to participate in weapons research.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A memoir,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All the great books are connected, in the library books on weapons development will be connected to books about suffering in war,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to books about the promise of World Peace...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And if not, then the Librarian will catch you with her smile, before you fall,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by contrast a Professor's smile is meaningless, if not fake.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Professors can only interfere with your development,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">no single university covers enough subjects to satisfy you, but a library does.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">While your Knowledge is a sure path to Wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there is something else, you need.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You need a taste of Greatness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you will never find it in a University town, never.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is but a handful of places on earth that will help you feel it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">those are the months long hiking trails found on each continent.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When you connect the triumph of adapting to the hardships of a trail,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in rain in snow...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">...to the inheritance of wisdom from books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am sorry to say, that the first thing you will feel is a brief flash rage and tears.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For how could the Good World and the Professors you once respected betray you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by putting you into a little dorm room.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And no lecture hall is big enough, or prestigious enough,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to impress you more than the stars, and the silence, and fragrance of woods.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">How could an old and experienced Professor teach you poetry, better,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">than your beating heart, on the eve of your first encounter with a Bear, and her cubs.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No professor could ever reach as deep into your heart,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as a book of inspirational verse, on that stormy night that you should have stayed in the valley below.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And the Greatness of a simple warm morning filled with the fragrance of pine trees with a hint of last evening's bonfire,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that thick moist air, as you hand spiritually pushes straight through each page of paper book that you now comprehend better than the author, the day he finished.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">He wrote as a mail sorter, or cast away, or patent clerk, or a star crossed overman,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but you read it, as an Emergent Masterpiece of The Universe, a Complete Human Being.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let the trail,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">become your semesters and diplomas and awards, and the returns to it, you never-ending graduation ceremony.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">SPEAK OUT,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">do not let the others live unaware that Universities in their mediocrity have fallen to Nature Trails and Audio Books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">SPEAK OUT,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">do not let other students aim for a job, their job is to build companies, onwards to becoming Great Leaders.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">SPEAK OUT,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">tell them about your rage and tears of being denied a real education that fits you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Speak Out,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">speak out.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In wisdom, and in certainty of knowing that your path is the correct path,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is the path of real results, Wisdom, and Greatness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The Trail,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and that thread, are one and the same.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And the grades, every one of your grades will far surpass any and all scales,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in cold rain, in snow too deep to traverse, in hunger two days out from the next town, upon your arrival you rise to a new height, that no grade can mark.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">After a few years,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">what you have weaved out of your books, will be unbreakable, and so unique as to extend precisely who yo are, far into, who you must become to reach greatness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A day will come, when you will notice the struggle of authors to rise higher,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and in sadness discover that you will find fewer and fewer books that move you, eventually where your last book ends.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your own book,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will start.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And you will add to the mountain peak you climbed,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and others will follow, and your book will become their last book, and so on.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That's how you will know what is real,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">what is fake, by taking every important step to the highest of heights and leaving your Soul behind for others to resurrect it when your book comes up.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Worry not, countless others have traveled these roads,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">wisdom is real, it is meaningful, it changes you and others for better, and your book will be irreplaceable and beloved by many.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And, no, it is foolish to think that you must become an author to write a book, there are too many of those books already,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you only need to become wise to write, there are no critics here, as you cry, the reader will cry, as you climb the next mountain, the reader will triumph with you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Take your self-education to the trails,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the nature will help you slow down and connect with the spirits of the authors stored within the books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Don't worry, it will be OK,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so as long as all your steps count as a triumph, your growing up will become an upward slope, and your life will eventually become as beautiful as you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And the last thing a Great Being discovers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is the answer to their first big question "Who am I?", it will all lay open as you look back from your golden age.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your path to wisdom intertwined with adventure and great discoveries,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and bears, and dunes, and Fox Fire, and rain and snow, and softness of moss, and endless seas of fern, open like all the great ideas behind all the most beloved of poems.</div>
