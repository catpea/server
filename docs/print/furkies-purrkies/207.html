  <p>Just like we are vulnerable,</p>
  <p>to listening to authority without question.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Just like we are blind to indoctrination,</p>
  <p>unable to see fast enough that reality had been warped.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We also have a problem of integration with Knowledge and Wisdom,</p>
  <p>if our days are too busy, stressful, too short, we won&apos;t be able to learn.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

  <p>Ensuring that we live at a proper pace,</p>
  <p>is part of taking care of our Mental and Intellectual Hygiene.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Our Mental Health is important,</p>
  <p>we should never forget to take care of our minds.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The pace you live at can prevent you from learning,</p>
  <p>so you have to live in balance, and in balance with time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>How do you know if you are out of balance?</p>
  <p>- that is actually a very easy question to answer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>When you feel, like you need to &quot;go somewhere&quot; to think,</p>
  <p>it means you are out of balance, and you need to re-prioritize matters in your life.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Thinking is critical to our well being,</p>
  <p>not being able to think, is a sign of trouble.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Experiencing difficulty with thinking and having ideas,</p>
  <p>means that we have to find a way to adjust our lifestyle.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Our minds are too powerful to try to shut them off,</p>
  <p>we are all geniuses, extremely powerful thinkers, with infinite imaginations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Past the point when we adjust to be able to enjoy storytelling,</p>
  <p>we have to choose books that feed our soul, that make us laugh and wonder.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Our minds need storytelling for enriching our imagination,</p>
  <p>a good book is always about some story being told.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Finally, don&apos;t let yourself be tricked by the appearance of books,</p>
  <p>or the simplicity and convenience of Audio Books.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A paper book is a very desperate attempt and hope,</p>
  <p>to share a deeply personal treasure.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A novel is often times a hidden way to say something,</p>
  <p>something that authors don&apos;t want to take personal responsibility for.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>If it is on paper,</p>
  <p>it is on paper because there was nothing else to put it on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>What other way to transfer Thought Treasures is there,</p>
  <p>paper is an improvement over story tellers that would memorize myths and recite them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I am sure there used to be professional readers,</p>
  <p>that would come to a wealthy persons house and beautifully recite a book.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But once we were able to record a book,</p>
  <p>an Audio Book became even better than a paper book.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>An Audio Book can transfer more emotion,</p>
  <p>and a book that is well read by the author, is a treasure, in deed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>An Audio Book will transfer more wisdom than the paper version,</p>
  <p>and do not forget about Documentaries, Videos, Lectures and Speeches.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The modern age has been able to greatly enrich the transfer of wisdom,</p>
  <p>I beg you to inherit it all, and I hope you do.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The greatest and most enriching Science, Philosophy, Adventure and Storytelling Books,</p>
  <p>have not been created to make money or for fame.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The greatest works,</p>
  <p>are works created out of Love for Future Generations.</p>

  <p>Personal Note,</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Due to the way copyright laws work there are many beautiful books in the Public Domain,</p>
  <p>if you were to challenge yourself to voice certain books in the most beautiful of ways,</p>
  <p>I am sure people from all around the world would love you for it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>
    Some books that that come to mind are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations" target="_blank">Meditations by Marcus Aurelius</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War">The Art of War by Sun Tzu</a> and
    of course <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagakure">Hagakure by Yamamoto Tsunetomo</a>.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Also, keep in mind what a wonderful treasure recordings you made in your youth become as time flows,</p>
  <p>what great inheritance to the children of the future to hear their Grand-grand-grand-grand Grandma,</p>
  <p>reading Jack London, Leo Tolstoy, Herman Melville, H. G. Wells, Mark Twain, Mary Shelley, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>...And uhh... you know, (and this is just between you and me),</p>
  <p>you could uhh... spice up the slower, dryer parts of said books.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You know, mistakes happen, you could for example mix up Mary Shelley&apos;s Frankenstein</p>
  <p>with H. G. Wells&apos; Time Machine, and add a sprinkle or two of The Whale by Herman Melville,</p>
  <p>and tie it all together with some sweet romantic story from your own wonderful life.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I assure you with all my heart,</p>
  <p>it will only make your art of reading,</p>
  <p>that much more fascinating.</p>
