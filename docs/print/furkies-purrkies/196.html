  <p>A system of institutions is like a collection of computer programs,</p>
  <p>where each program relies on the other for valid information.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Cities are powered by institutions, and when institutions go bad,</p>
  <p>the entire city suffers; similar to how a computer will begin misbehaving.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The central processing unit of an institution, is people working within its walls,</p>
  <p>it is a human powered computer, unlike machines, human based computers can self-repair.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A small and common example of a Human Powered computer is the modern Trash Truck,</p>
  <p>the one that only has the driver operating that huge claw.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Another example is an unmanned aircraft,</p>
  <p>whose operator is somewhere on the ground.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And a more down to the ground example is the modern supermarket Self-Checkout,</p>
  <p>whenever the customer has a problem, the computer system will actually dispatch a human being for help.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Finally, the first known instance of a Human Powered Machine is the Turk,</p>
  <p>it was a 1770 Chess Playing machine hoax, that had the operator hiding inside.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>Here I bring attention to Failure, where the Education System,</p>
  <p>is no longer operating, and thus causing stress, depression, poverty and desperation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>On the scale of a city when Education fails, it will cause an increase in crime,</p>
  <p>and a city will begin filling its jails with those who were pushed to a breaking point out of desperation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>When institutions of a system such as a city begin failing,</p>
  <p>all institutions are negatively affected.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Therefore it is in the best interest of all institutions to ensure integrity across the city,</p>
  <p>and when that equilibrium can no longer be reached others, need to be artificially powered down.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>For example we can&apos;t fail students and then start sending them to jail,</p>
  <p>we have to scale the Justice System in proportion to how well the schools an other related systems are operating.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And wait for all to reach a healthy equilibrium.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We cannot perform business as usual, on one end, when the other is broken,</p>
  <p>that can only further destabilize the system and cause even more damage.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The institutions of a city must not isolate themselves from reality,</p>
  <p>the reason why we are not replacing Human Powered Institutions with Mere Machines, is Heart.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The Heart,</p>
  <p>and Love for the citizen.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>For a city to be called a city, and not a heartless machine for forcing human beings into desperation,</p>
  <p>the poor, uneducated, ill, and homeless, must come first, they must be granted safe homes, medical care, and welfare.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A city must be judged by what happens to the least fortunate,</p>
  <p>way out on the borders that most tend to look away from.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Then; we must practice Crime Prevention by means of a Functional Real Education Systems,</p>
  <p>that use the city&apos;s funds to help its students out of poverty by helping them to operate small businesses,</p>
  <p>as a way of investing into its own not so distant future.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>In a city without of balance,</p>
  <p>&quot;the best we can&quot; may often become &quot;the worst we&apos;ve had.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We must practice preferential treatment for the disadvantaged,</p>
  <p>for the uneducated, for those in dire need, and for the ill.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Let us call this:</p>
  <p>Love Above Law,</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The Future, and Future Generation demand,</p>
  <p>that the Justice System learns to see,</p>
  <p>because it is not meant to be a blind machine.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It was never about business as usual,</p>
  <p>because time, never, stood still.</p>
