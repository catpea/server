    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Of Political Systems</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A system of institutions is like a collection of computer programs,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">where each program relies on the other for valid information.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Cities are powered by institutions, and when institutions go bad,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the entire city suffers; similar to how a computer will begin misbehaving.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The central processing unit of an institution, is people working within its walls,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is a human powered computer, unlike machines, human based computers can self-repair.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A small and common example of a Human Powered computer is the modern Trash Truck,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the one that only has the driver operating that huge claw.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Another example is an unmanned aircraft,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">whose operator is somewhere on the ground.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And a more down to the ground example is the modern supermarket Self-Checkout,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">whenever the customer has a problem, the computer system will actually dispatch a human being for help.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Finally, the first known instance of a Human Powered Machine is the Turk,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it was a 1770 Chess Playing machine hoax, that had the operator hiding inside.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Here I bring attention to Failure, where the Education System,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is no longer operating, and thus causing stress, depression, poverty and desperation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">On the scale of a city when Education fails, it will cause an increase in crime,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and a city will begin filling its jails with those who were pushed to a breaking point out of desperation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When institutions of a system such as a city begin failing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">all institutions are negatively affected.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Therefore it is in the best interest of all institutions to ensure integrity across the city,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and when that equilibrium can no longer be reached others, need to be artificially powered down.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For example we can't fail students and then start sending them to jail,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we have to scale the Justice System in proportion to how well the schools an other related systems are operating.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And wait for all to reach a healthy equilibrium.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We cannot perform business as usual, on one end, when the other is broken,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that can only further destabilize the system and cause even more damage.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The institutions of a city must not isolate themselves from reality,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the reason why we are not replacing Human Powered Institutions with Mere Machines, is Heart.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The Heart,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and Love for the citizen.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For a city to be called a city, and not a heartless machine for forcing human beings into desperation,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the poor, uneducated, ill, and homeless, must come first, they must be granted safe homes, medical care, and welfare.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A city must be judged by what happens to the least fortunate,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">way out on the borders that most tend to look away from.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Then; we must practice Crime Prevention by means of a Functional Real Education Systems,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that use the city's funds to help its students out of poverty by helping them to operate small businesses,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as a way of investing into its own not so distant future.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In a city without of balance,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"the best we can" may often become "the worst we've had."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We must practice preferential treatment for the disadvantaged,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for the uneducated, for those in dire need, and for the ill.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us call this:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Love Above Law,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The Future, and Future Generation demand,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that the Justice System learns to see,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because it is not meant to be a blind machine.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It was never about business as usual,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because time, never, stood still.</div>
