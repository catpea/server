  <p>We, or the younger generations may find ourselves in situations where life does not make sense,</p>
  <p>where too many things are contradictory, ineffective, and too broken to be of any real use.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>When we are children we are taught falsehoods,</p>
  <p>indoctrinated into religions, made to think of politics as special, and schools as critical.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We have no chance to question anything,</p>
  <p>we have no experience at all.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Religions, broken politics and ineffective schools feed on blind belief,</p>
  <p>if we taught children the truth they would try to help the world grow.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Plus, it does not take very long before life gets real, with bullies, rockets, wars, or illnesses,</p>
  <p>and when we are placed on an imaginary foundation, we can&apos;t quite fight all that back, not very effectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Educated or not, Human Beings are still very special, and will fight for what little they know,</p>
  <p>it is a terrible tragedy when people fight for something imaginary, that in the end, means nothing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Just out of respect for children, and for the future generations to whom this planet truly belongs to,</p>
  <p>we must resist propagating fantasies and myths.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The governments are not external forces, and they are not fully functional,</p>
  <p>they are made to be ran by the people of their nations, and depend on schools that produce real results.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We can&apos;t teach the younger generations that World Peace is a funny fantasy,</p>
  <p>World Peace has been the next important step for a century now.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Levels of education, wisdom, and greatness all around the world, need to increase,</p>
  <p>while schools do work to some degree, they mean little when compared to self education and real results.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is cruel to teach children lessons that will frighten them with a world that does not make sense,</p>
  <p>all-the-while real life is happening and they need real facts and not imaginary opinions and wishful thinking.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Worst of all, we propagate myths because it is easier to pass on a faerie tale,</p>
  <p>than to read a thousand books about the world and growing up.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Let us all put an end to this cycle to strangeness,</p>
  <p>let us all aim to become self educated with world&apos;s finest books and lectures, onward to becoming wise.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Let us inspire the younger generations with facts and not mere opinions,</p>
  <p>and let us remind, that the world and the politics and schools that demand great repairs, all belongs to them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>May we all rise and rise,</p>
  <p>until the world becomes wise.</p>
</div></div>
