    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Learning To Learn</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Learning is like climbing a mountain,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there are no shortcuts, and you have to go step by step.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And it is also like putting a computer together,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or wiring a home entertainment center, you can't leave something out.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is also like learning just a little bit about ice skating,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you really need to carefully step on that ice and see what it feels like.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Learning for real, is the same as having fun,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">being fascinated about what you are doing, enjoying it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Finally, learning for real is also about long term achievement,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">like section hiking the Appalachian Trail over many decades...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">...and then arriving at Mount Katahdin, come your golden age;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is about making a difference, and becoming better for it, adding to greater whole.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When we go to school, and we end up thinking,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if I jump through these hoops I will graduate and then I'll figure the next step.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The strong sequence, the integrated whole, becomes a wet rag,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the aim becomes a carrot on a stick, things become unclear, but we keep going.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is OK to make this mistake,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so as long as we learn from it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So as long as we learn,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and prevent others from being taken advantage of the same way.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Begin asking questions about education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">don't just sit there memorizing disconnected facts, demand a real education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We all have computers now,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we should all learn about programming.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We need to know that a <span>function<sup>[1]</sup></span> takes an input,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">transforms it, often by calling other functions, and return an output, output = function(input);</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We need to know what a <span>loop<sup>[2]</sup></span> is,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that it often processes a list of items, one at a time, calling functions with the item as input.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For example, for every user in a list,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if membership expires soon on this user, then send warning message for this user.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Programming, is so simple,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that it only takes a few days to learn.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have to do it right,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that is what schools were meant to help us with.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For example, YOU NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER, start by just creating a file,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and then configuring things, NO, you start with a <span>boilerplate<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Only later, when you have time to waste,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you go and read the darn <span>manual or guide<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I am actually serious about this,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the manual will never tell you what the most important parts are relative to your use case.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you just need a window with a blank canvas,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for a little 50 line wiki that helps you study, you don't need to worry about drop downs, or icon sizes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You will return many times to the things that are useful,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and with each use case, you will learn a new way of using the program, that is far more than any documentation can explain.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Another huge deal, is the language you start with,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I know many programming languages but I don't use them, some are too old, but in most cases they just do things badly and are too small.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The language you choose must be the one getting the most stress, attention, and hate,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because to hate a language is to admit to have learned the wrong one.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Today that language is <span>ES2021<sup>[5]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is the evolution of <span>JavaScript<sup>[6]</sup></span>, the language behind all the web applications, that also runs on the server via <span>node.js<sup>[7]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are some strong side languages that are worth considering venturing into,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but just bookmark them and forget it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You need to learn language that will help you create cute little command line programs, mighty web apps,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">quick and dirty web servers that never complain under real stress, and desktop applications, including powerful code editors.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Above all, it all needs to be cross platform,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so that you never have to worry about rewriting your program for a different operating system.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To learn something, we need really competent teachers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">who learned what they know not from textbooks, but from experience.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If it is not possible to have good teachers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then it is more important to lean on your own first, and then go to school to get the diploma.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If the school isn't teaching then you are not going to learn anything,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you are only going to learn something that isn't even all that useful.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In closing, I would like to share with you, the most ridiculous and tiny little programming thing I have ever learned,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this is from a manual of a program unlikely to be taught in any school, the program is called <span>CouchDB<sup>[8]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is just a little tidbit,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that jumped out at me, and I've been using it like clay in my own code experiments.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When working on the web not only do you have multiple people saving data at the same time,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but also multiple instances of your program handling the traffic, usually one per CPU core.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">People normally just use a database a program that is far and away,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and is designed to handle multiple connections.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But to me that adds extra complexity,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I once had MySQL database go down for no reason at all, the server was offline, perfectly configured, indexed with quality SQL, and there was nothing in the logs.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">At that point I was doing simple data gathering for a prestigious institution,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the reason I used a proper database, is to avoid things getting broken like this without explanation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In that moment I promised myself to play with files a little bit more,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I wanted to find a way to save a file under the stress of multiple simultaneous connections.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Years later reading up on CouchDB, the way they stored their records,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">made me jump, it was both suspicions and lovely.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I invented my own tiny theory about it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a demand that no matter what happens, information must always be stored on disk, and as soon as it is possible.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you have many users trying to update some common piece of information,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">such as the profile of a school, the chances of one overriding the other are very high.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Inspired by Couch, I create a directory, named after the file I want to save,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and then as people try to save that file, I store their information in a randomly named file inside the directory.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The first and foremost, is that all data, from all users and processes is saved,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it can never be lost, every file that I save in that directory has a long random file name that is guaranteed to be unique.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even if Alice and Bob, save Manhattan International High School Profile at the same time,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the server records their information in two different files, no data is lost.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The filenames also contain version numbers, it is possible to track conflicts,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the system can now flag when two people saved at the same time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But more than that, the really cool part is that many servers storing files this way,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">can synchronize together, as the files are always uniquely named, so thousand servers can keep in sync tracking all changes, marking wherever there are edit conflicts.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">People saving data can see conflicts,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and resolve them as they make their updates.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I don't want to write too much about the details of this program,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but a conflict occurs when both Alice and Bob edit version 10 of the Manhattan International High School Profile, hit save at the same time, and call it a day.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That means that two versions 11 exist, no data is lost, but the person in charge of school profiles will see a red flag,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and may investigate, and mark one of the files as deleted.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Another notable thing is that if nobody cares to resolve the conflict,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there is this crazy way of deciding which version 11 is going to be used.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You know how those files are randomly named,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the conflicting files are sorted alphanumerically and the first one wins.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is an arbitrary election mechanism,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but no matter the circumstance, CPU core, user, or server, it is an arbitrary but consistent election process, that always returns the same winner.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What I describe here,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is saving a file.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I have a feeling that only practicing and learning on your own,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will make you sensitive, or maybe even passionate about such little gems.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even if this ever made it to a test,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">how is marking that correctly on a multiple choice exam, or even even making a fake little homework program going to emphasize this as special.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And before any pro complains about using this in production,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this is a useful data backup mechanism, that should be used along side a proper database.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Learning for real is an adventure,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you make fascinating discoveries in your travel.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is better to learn on your own and then go to school to graduate,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if you still wan to.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Learning for real will also make you happy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I enjoy experimenting with different variations of the CouchDB inspired file saving mechanism.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Visualizing data being saved without any obstruction, if statement or error,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">sure makes for a fun programming session.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In school we get stressed out about passing the exams,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or trying to graduate in half the time to save money, and that is no way to learn.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That is not how a Student should be treated,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a Student represents the future of humanity, they should be treated with great dignity and respect.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think time has come to view schools that charge for education, and companies that require a diploma,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as institutions that have little talent, will eventually either lose credibility, or just go out of business.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What does a company that demands a diploma say,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">about its stability and your retirement plan, what does it say about the talent that you will encounter there.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Will your co-workers be passionate about making cute little file saving discoveries,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or is it all going to be about profit maximization and promotions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once you retire,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the real work starts.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You now enter an age where you are experienced enough to make lasting contributions,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to leave an inspired and meaningful legacy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And at this stage in your life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">having learned for real, becomes even more important, as you rely on it, to become a Great Being.</div>
