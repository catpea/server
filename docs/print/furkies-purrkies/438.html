      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">On Understanding The World</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To understand the world, you must stop assuming that everything is how it should be.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You have to get used to the idea that the world needs your help, almost nothing works.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You will be able to see examples of that everywhere, once you take time to listen to, and read books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Other than noticing that everything is incomplete, you will never fully grasp the world.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The understanding of the world, is a process, it must be.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You can only understand the things that call to you, and that education is the key.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Most, if not all misunderstandings are rooted in greatly varying levels of education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When levels of real education rise, the world becomes wiser.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As the world grows in wisdom, misunderstandings fade away and Peace arrives.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Not all education is equal, real education is rare.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is far simpler to take to the books that call to you, than to wait for a teacher that can inspire you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Be careful when it comes to organized education, it is safer to learn directly from the world's most beloved thinkers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Eventually you will no doubt hope to make a difference, but there is a great and heartbreaking problem with that.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It may not be possible to help those who are already suffering, it may only be realistic to make their pain count more, by preventing it in the future.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not all great challenges are like this, but once a war starts, there are no winners, nor will there ever be.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To make changes that last, you may have to focus on prevention.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You have to look into the future, as you won't be able to reliably change the present, not always.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To reliably change the future, you must help the world learn, increases the world's level of education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have to help the world remember, that it was lack of knowledge that kept the world in misery.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Your greatest adversaries will not only tower over you, but will outlive you by centuries.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They will turn misery and borders, into profit, a minuscule amount from billions of people.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The word kind of an education, is the one that stops the student from learning more.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Be it with false promises, fantasies, or by replacing real education with meaningless memorization tests and grades.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once a student becomes either convinced that they know enough, or tricked into not wanting to learn anymore, the world becomes darker for it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Dark ages is not a thing that you can witness, as they are spread across multiple centuries.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The darkness is just the symbol, for lack of education, lack of enlightenment.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The future generations will be able to see it when looking back at us, but we won't.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The urgency with which every human being, must be given books and knowledge in a way that helps them grow, is of an order of magnitude higher than we can comprehend.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Screaming Climate, Pandemics, Wars, Racism, Concentration Camps, Solitary Confinement, Police Brutality, and Punishment By Death, will do nothing to help the world understand.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Most don't even know about the <span>Holocene Extinction<sup>[1]</sup></span>, all of this is a function of their level of education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our Empathy and Compassion for each other, also scales with Knowledge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We are all born perfect, and we are all beautiful.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But we must not start at zero, we must be born to the greatest heights of the previous generation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Without real education, not only do we repeat the same mistakes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But we keep adding more weight to them, and make the suffering of the previous generations count for nothing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Real education enhances us, it improves us, and refines our operating system, decision making mechanisms, and powers of perception.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You can't stand up to a war, a global cult, or fantasy education, you will be so small they won't even notice you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But you can prevent it from propagating into the future, help your classmates, protect them from fake teacher, share narrated books.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Use the stress of fake education to ignite their passion for True Wisdom, help them see the Liars and the Fools, help them see the fraud of <span>Fake Education<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Help them see how in poverty those who claim authority, trade the Best Minds of The Future Generation, for a small paycheck.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The propagation of the darkness-and-misery of our age, under the collective and self defeating excuse...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">of putting some food, on their table.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Above all, and in more ways, than we can grasp.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The following words, will always hold true.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is either all of us, or none.</div>
