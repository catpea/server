    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Conscious life is a magnificent accident on such an impossibly large scale,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that it becomes the single most important miracle in the universe.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You, I, all the other Earthlings,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and all the other conscious life out there: we are the meaning of this universe.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are all connected with this incredible feat of emergence; Consciousness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it does not matter where we come from or how we look - if we can see ourselves - we are Family.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our minds were crafted by an adaptive process,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that step by step, improved on the previous.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The steps were not aimed at anything in particular,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and are far from perfect.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But consciousness is something different,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is not random, it is not a function of mere adaptive mechanics of accidents, and fundamental principles.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Consciousness allows us to deliberately and in foresight, cross the line between mere evolution,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">onward into Freedom of Will, Love Of Life, and Power of Knowledge, and Light Of Wisdom; and Love, Good Will, and Lasting Peace brought on by Greatness of Vision, Heart and Spirit.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We must deliberately aim to <span>push away the flaws that the meanderings of nature instilled in us<sup>[1]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by the countless accidents of the process of our initial emergence as conscious beings.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If we don't detach,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">our minds will be held back by racism, xenophobia, nationalism, group-think, fear, hate, and blindness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We will point Nuclear Weapons at each other,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and list the flags of our enemies as if it was a checklist for advancement.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What may seem like a soap opera news program to the educated,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">can be perceived as reality and opportunity to the poor, starving or disadvantaged, who did not know to seek real education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have introduced a device of deliberate advancement for all Human Beings,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that device was supposed to pull us towards a Wiser State of Existence.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But its aim was lost, it was an experiment that has never fully reached its goal,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and ended up being used by the poor, as means to put food on the table.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That noble experiment.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">was organized education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Today it may cost as much as a million dollars or more and in unforgivable student loans,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to become a medical expert.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Don't bother trying to understand why schools failed, there is no time,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">simply accept the responsibility for your own education, and begin immediately.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are many flaws in our perception,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the biggest one is our tendency to follow leaders.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But the act of following, is an act of destruction,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we are each to lead, we are never to follow, ever.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Self education by means of reading or listening to books held in high esteem by the world's most prominent intellectuals,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">paves the road towards a balanced and enlightened view of the world, and the view of our place in it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Lead<sup>[2]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>we have followed before, and came all-too-close to the end.<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All the people that hate, that want to cause harm, are just ill from lack of growing up, from lack of education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">from standing in-place, without ever knowing to reach for books, for wisdom, and for greatness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When we stand in the place that we are born into,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we come under the control of the flaws, that consciousness, easily allows us to escape.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You must withstand the culture you are born into, the neighborhood you are born into,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the poverty you are born into, be it of mind, or wallet, or both.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You must resist the urge of belonging, cheaply and effortlessly,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as that is the oldest recruitment mechanism to make a slave - to turn a young person, old and bitter.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This power must not end with you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you have to ignite all the others that you meet in your great adventures.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So that the importance of fine and balanced self education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">rings around the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Not until we are all abloom with Knowledge and Wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will we have time to take to our careers, and retirement, and enjoyment of our golden age.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The un-educated world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is not a safe place for all.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We need real education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the borders must go.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Become an inspiration,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">may your poetry,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">never be forgotten.</div>
