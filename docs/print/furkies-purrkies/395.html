      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">My Greatest Archaeological Discovery, That Belonged In A Museum!</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I was digging in Eastern Europe,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it was an old Airplane Field.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There was a number of bunkers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and there was a house in the city that still had bullet holes in it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It was meant to be a reminder,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">of what the city walls used to look like.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They were building a new apartment complex,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in preparation for new infrastructure there was a new dig.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It was maybe four times my height,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this was right at edge of the old air-field</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It was used as a land fill right after the war ended,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or they were expanding it, by bringing rubble from another land-fill.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It was a rough day,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I woke up early.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And set of for the dig site,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I had plenty of time left before the work crew showed up.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So, I focused on careful excavation of the site,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">layer by layer, artifact by artifact.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I found many bottles,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">some of them could have gone as far back as early 1800s, it seemed.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I found graphite sticks dating back to early 40s,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">these were likely of military origin, used in batteries to power portable equipment.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I hit a patch of <span>Redware<sup>[1]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but it was hard to be sure, because of all the red shingles and crushed brick.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As I was trying to make sense of what I had on this site,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I remembered a kid from across the city with a jar of black power.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Crazy, son of a gun, was saying it was Trinitrotoluene,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that he extracted from rusted armor piercing rounds, as in tank armor.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I hope he was wrong, and I hope is is OK,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the only reason to have a deadly jar like that, is to try to light it later on, poor bastard.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just last month, early March 2021, <span>a 550 lb (or quarter ton). bomb was discovered<sup>[2]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">over at Popowice, which wasn't that far away, it is no joke.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>The expert states that it was a Russian bomb of German manufacture, and says that they have a name for them "Rusty Death"<sup>[3]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and explains that the rust is only on the surface, the bomb is still an active explosive.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Search internet for <span>550-pound WWII bomb In Munich, 2012<sup>[4]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to see how enormous, and city shaking those explosions are - since these bombs cannot be moved, the only safe way to remove them, is to detonate them on purpose after evacuating the town.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You don't become an Archaeologist,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Archaeology finds you, when it has something to say.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Then I saw it, it was a shiny colorful and beautiful round object,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">about the size of my hand.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It was a crystal, at first I thought the color came from it sitting in the ground,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but now, I am certain, it was an iridescent crystal.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I brushed away the deep dark soil, and gasped,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and just stood there holding it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It was a crystal snail,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it was not some part of a expensive chandelier, it was a work of art that stood on its own.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I couldn't believe it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I found a treasure lost to history, it could be much much older than the dig site, a family heirloom, maybe.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But you know how it is,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">history will let you hold it, but it belongs to her.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For the moment that I held it in my hand,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it seemed like time has stopped.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But now, it begun flowing again,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and almost like after a loud explosion, I regained my hearing, to discover I am being shouted at.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The workers, arrived a the site,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they were packed in the bed of a huge dump truck that they used for moving the rubble as they dig.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They were shouting because they saw a Nine Year old boy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by the flat wall of a deep hole, these walls have a tendency to collapse.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I still had to crawl out of there, it was still very deep for me,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the earth was really soft.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I threw my Crystal Snail up on top of the wall I had to climb,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and as I made my way up there among all the shouting and the truck being really close,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I lost site of it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and I searched for it courageously until the workers were right there.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But it was gone,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I lost my magical treasure.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Post Scriptum,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Here, I mark the <span>location of my dig site<sup>[5]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and where I lost my magical crystal snail, 51&#xB0;07'34.0"N 16&#xB0;57'25.0"E, it could be beneath the sidewalk, but perhaps the hole I was in was the foundation for that six story building.</div>
