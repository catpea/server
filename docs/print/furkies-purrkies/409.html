      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The Older Business People</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you ever go to a prestigious show,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">maybe to see a famous philosopher, or a group of amazing speakers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The wisest people there,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in as far as they care, will only judge you in two ways.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They will judge your spirit,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by looking at your love for and the magnificence of the person you are with.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And they will judge you by how far you have traveled</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with the aim to make lasting contributions to human kind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They won't care about your car, or how much you paid for your outfit,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they won't care about your schools, or salary, or where you come from.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They will care about your integrity, weather or not you are a complete person,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and what you have done with your self awareness in context of the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Schools, including High School, College, and University,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">hold us back somehow, even after school... we still move and think wrong.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We move too slow, because of what schools put us through,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they give us the wrong impression of the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We need to read top selling books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and schools encourage us to appreciate books in the public domain.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Sherlock Holmes, and Robinson Crusoe are great when you are on a vacation,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but when it comes to the future of your existence you need books that transform your culture.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Books that help you move from asking about things to actually figuring out how those things work,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and telling peoples about them in a way that inspires them to understand the world more.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Schools do the opposite, and same for Med School,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">until Med School starts paying you half a million dollars for the fact that your hard earned milestones will make their hospital better, it is not yet worth the mind and time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are the future, you are not supposed to pay for school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you! should be getting paid for it, as that is an investment in the future of human kind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Paying schools is crazy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and only propagates that idiotic and predatory system.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have to be able to get up on the stage,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and spend eighteen minutes <span>passionately speaking about something that matters to you<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">School is not going to teach you that,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it will only hold you back.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have to move people,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">not by preparing a speech but by speaking from you heart.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That is a real test,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">having moved mountains, and being ready to move an audience, and towards wisdom and cheerfulness, hope.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just as soon as you feel comfortable with independence,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you have to begin becoming a business person.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even if all you will ever do,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is scribble company diagrams.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Becoming a business person is a huge part of growing up,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there is nothing to be found in being a good student.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A good business person, or an intellectual,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will discover all their education as they grow towards their highest aims.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We must integrate knowledge,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we can't just memorize disconnected facts.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We need a complete and well integrated road forward,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and we need to move at the right pace, and in the exact sequence that fits us best.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No one has that curriculum,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but the person is actually doing the walking.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Accept the responsibility for your own education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">take to life changing books that move the world forwards towards wisdom, and unity.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let the culture of all those Authors, Speakers, Mountain Movers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">merge with your culture, inherit from their works and their thinking.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do not trust schools with the knowledge that will dictate all the life ahead of you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">become a well read intellectual, and businessperson... and find a way to help the world grow.</div>
