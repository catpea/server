    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">A Workout That Will Work Out</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Above all, all the heavy people in the word,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">work out a lot, year after year building muscle under all that weight.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Getting into exercise can be hard,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">depending how large we get.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Dieting, is complicated because we need food,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is not OK to just stop eating.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In this little poem,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I will explain how to get started.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You will need to change your daily routine,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because 20, 30, maybe 40 years of your life is at stake, here.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">While it is not true, overeating does signal the you don't care about yourself,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or spending those extra 20 - 40 years with your loved ones.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us correct this,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and never look back.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">First of all and half-jokingly speaking in order to illustrate change of routine,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if you can, please safely get rid of your refrigerator, stove, microwave, grill, skillet and electric skillet, pots and pans, and toaster.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you upset your loved ones,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">just tell them that this is your way of showing that you do care, and want to be around for a long looong time because you love them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Alternatively you can buy a bunch of little luggage locks,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and thread them through the holes in the plugs... and throw away the keys.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And if you tried all this already, and none of it worked,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">just cut off the plugs, but be very careful with your stove, it is better to get rid of the skillet, pots and pans, or call a professional to remove the stove.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I expect you will do such a thing in your imagination, or maybe unplug something,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but this will immediate put you in a different world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Because how are you going to heat up your fancy burrito,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you won't, because the burrito in not a good thing, it was trying to murder you all along.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once you take a step back, and consider how much ketchup, dressing, and salt, and pepper, you were adding to things,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you will realize that the real taste of most of the foods you like it not all that good, and it gets a lot worse the more you eat.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I mean if you have to drown something in spices and condiments,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is not that tasty, plus it is trying to kill you, in multiple ways, and all of them are awful.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Food is only meant to give us energy and keep us healthy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">comfort is to be found in adventure.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Big adventure,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">big change.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Begin walking, buy a large and comfy seat and begin riding your bicycle,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and try to go out there early in the morning when it is still dark, everything smells so nice in the morning.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And set your aim on the <span>Appalachian Trail<sup>[1]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or the <span>Pacific Crest Trail<sup>[2]</sup></span>, whichever one is closer to you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is that walking routine,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that long trail that will help you get your weight under control.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Listen plenty of <span>Narrated Books<sup>[3]</sup></span>, and fill many a journal,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and know that the prize that you reach at the end of your adventure, is extra years added to your beautiful life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once you had enough of the trails,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">begin your <span>Couch to 5K jogging workout<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And once you are comfortably jogging at a nice pace,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">take to dancing, more specifically Shuffle Dancing, and from time to time with dumbbells.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The truth is,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">your life is very important.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Life has to be lived in a balanced way,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">where we don't do things that shorten our life, but quite to the contrary.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Life can get scary, but it is still worth the while,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">walking long trails and inventing new dance moves eventually becomes pretty silly and fun, and even beautiful.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is nothing more important than your health,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">tomorrow, maybe don't go to work, but go shopping for a nice pair of walking shoes with extra soft socks.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Make the Couch to 5K program, your friend,</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>instead of using it to jog, use it to improve your walking distance<sup>[5]</sup></span>, don't worry about running it at first, just enjoy yourself.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think the most important piece of advice I can give is, listen to Audio Books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">listen to books about marathon runners, nutrition, sugar, salt, and fat, and above all adventure books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Year after year you will add a few extra years to your life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and year after year discover how much your muscles grew in all those years of being heavy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Be good to yourself,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and when you are ready, try to help others, and inspire them to long and great adventures.</div>
