  <p>I know all too well that writing books is hard,</p>
  <p>as far as I can tell; I am still learning English.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But books, share principles, with life,</p>
  <p>be it book or life, it is always page after page, it has chapters.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Books are not, some fancy extra,</p>
  <p>but a pretty fancy way of rising, just rising.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And perhaps it is somewhat old fashioned to be urging you to write books,</p>
  <p>but I don&apos;t feel bad at all.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I expect the first one is the hardest,</p>
  <p>the second one will be shoooo goood,</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The third one - I am sorry,</p>
  <p>will feel as floppy as a thinly sliced ham.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The fourth one,</p>
  <p>after that long wonderful pause.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Will surely be the one,</p>
  <p>it will feel like such a closure.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But listen,</p>
  <p>I suspect that we don&apos;t really get started until our fifth book.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>&apos;Cause you know,</p>
  <p>it is the book you don&apos;t think about writing that gets you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And, I think I can actually predict enough of it to say,</p>
  <p>that as children we look to the future, as adults we grow, and as Great Beings we look at the past with wise eyes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>See, it is not until we get there, and glance over at ideas that we were passionate about when young,</p>
  <p>but now through the eyes of the Great Being... that all of a sudden, things like Amor Fati, are not merely about Love of Fate,</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But also, from when we look at life,</p>
  <p>see when looking back we see fate as something that that largely already unfolded.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And now, the love for it fits,</p>
  <p>it is the love for all we&apos;ve been through.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>All the battles we fought and learned from regardless it it was triumph or disaster, ease or hardship,</p>
  <p>it was what we grew <strong>so profound</strong>, what made us, ourselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>So as long, as we fought to rise,</p>
  <p>so as long as it counts for more than whim and being pushed around.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It doesn&apos;t matter how hard things were,</p>
  <p>it matters that nothing took away from our Love of Life.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>That we faced those challenges,</p>
  <p>easy or difficult.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Because now,</p>
  <p>you sit at the typewriter, and you know the story dot for dot.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>See, we have to live our life so sturdily,</p>
  <p>as to bring enlightenment to our Elder Selves, and perhaps make them cry a little - and why the heck not!</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>See, growing is not just for getting somewhere,</p>
  <p>but also building what will eventually become our Beautiful Past.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And though as children we may need to admit to ourselves that we don&apos;t understand everything,</p>
  <p>as Great Beings come Our Golden Age, we will understand what we once struggled with.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And with a great sense of accomplishment,</p>
  <p>a sense of accomplishment that wouldn&apos;t be there, had we not challenged ourselves with things that were out of our grasp when we were young.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>So what may seem as difficulty in our youth,</p>
  <p>we will end up loving in our Golden Age for making us stronger and more profound.</p>
