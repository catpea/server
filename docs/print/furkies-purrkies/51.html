  <p>At the center of our being,</p>
  <p>we each have a collection.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It makes us unique,</p>
  <p>but we never lose our connection.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>As with all things in life,</p>
  <p>it is too easy to get lost in strife.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We have to protect what makes us unique,</p>
  <p>if you fail, your future will be bleak.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>With all things we do,</p>
  <p>sometimes the bad guys slip through.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>This is what we need courage for,</p>
  <p>to look them in the eyes, and slam the door.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The unique collection at our center, is our power.</p>
  <p>It transforms, and evolves, hour after hour.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We start with just the Ocean, Skies, Mountains, Stars, Earth and Mars,</p>
  <p>maybe Flowers, Gardens, Kittens, Dogs, Horses and Frogs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But then it grows, call it soul, or spirit, personality or vitality,</p>
  <p>it becomes... Beauty, Endurance, Authenticity, Nobility, Love and Dignity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And it keeps growing, so as long as you Love Yourself,</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It creates Leaders, Protectors, Guides, Teachers, Dreamers,</p>
  <p>Adventurers, Explorers and Discoverers,</p>
  <p>Intellectuals, Humanitarians, Philosophers,</p>
  <p>Scientists, Astronomers,</p>
  <p>Dancers, Athletes, Bodybuilders,</p>
  <p>Chefs, Blacksmiths, and Makers,</p>
  <p>Musicians, Poets, Sculptors, Photographers and Filmmakers,</p>
  <p>Artists and Designers,</p>
  <p>Hackers and Programmers,</p>
  <p>Genius...</p>
  <p>Visionaries...</p>
  <p>Founders....</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You have to protect what makes you unique at all cost,</p>
  <p>if you start letting go, you will become lost.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And many will come, and many with care and kindness,</p>
  <p>and they will try to change you, in their blindness.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You cannot grow up, if you start letting go,</p>
  <p>you need an unbroken chain, you need that flow.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You have to learn to say,</p>
  <p>that it&apos;s either you, the one one who stands and is true,</p>
  <p>or you are through.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>To grow up, into who you need to be,</p>
  <p>is your right, and your dignity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>To let bullies push you around,</p>
  <p>is to fail, and falter,</p>
  <p>and run aground.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Decades, decades after they are long gone, do not let go,</p>
  <p>do not take their turns, do not change your view,</p>
  <p>you must aim to become worthy of you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Whether you believe in Heroes,</p>
  <p>on that we are only Human.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is the same height,</p>
  <p>just a maximum of our might.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Push, and stand up, and aim up, and rise,</p>
  <p>Open your eyes,</p>
  <p>it is the only way to become wise.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Fight for who you are,</p>
  <p>because in time,</p>
  <p>that fight is also for who you need to be.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>For who you need to be,</p>
  <p>to be strong and healthy,</p>
  <p>and unbreakable and worthy.</p>
</div></div>
