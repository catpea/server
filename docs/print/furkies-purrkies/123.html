    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When we are still learning what the world is,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we find comfort in recognizing where something starts, and where it ends.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Knowing the beginning and seeing the ending helps us feel in control,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it helps us see the journey's end, or the height of a challenge.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But all of that goes away when we begin rising,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">eventually we only consider the forward motion it self.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We ignore the beginning, we abandon the ends, we ignore the steps,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and we stop measuring the distance and paying attention to the effort.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In advancing forward we learn to recognize that all things must connect,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we can only find peace in a mesh-work of common concerns and dreams upheld by all.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The roads we must travel have no limits, and it never takes long to catch up,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">nobody falls behind for too long unless they practice resignation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We need not travel far to begin seeing that the word is still very young,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that passage of wisdom between generations is a very fragile process.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Many, who are not yet mature enough for the position they have gained, may feign authority,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we have to be careful who we listen to and be mindful of the paths they have traveled.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are the sum of all our rising, all our triumph, effort, and intent across all our ages,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">how we rose, and the choices we made, and the wisdom we grew with, all adds to the sum.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That sum doesn't just outline our personality and who we are in the now,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is the structure of our wisdom and the body of our knowledge, directed towards who we will become in the future.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A choice we make in the now, will paint a moment in our past, but also influence what is yet to come,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and all the choices added together create who we are in the future that we will eventually enter.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We must take great care of our choices, we must take care to love ourselves,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to find the calm and peace from which we can make healthy decisions that will help us grow.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Not everyone will start in a colorful city with good schools and amazing friends,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">some will struggle to rise out of extremes that will never make sense.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But we must still set ourselves on that unlimited path,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and get used to the idea of no beginnings, and no ends, just that all too human forward motion.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The direction is always the same, move towards wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that is the meeting point of all human beings no matter their circumstance or culture.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We begin as children, we mature into adults, and then we must go on to become Great Beings,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">all Greatness is rooted in Love of Wisdom, and the root of wisdom is found in boldly facing the challenges of life.</div>
