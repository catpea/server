  <p>Like steps on a mountain, each epoch stands in support of the next,</p>
  <p>like the pages of a journal, together, they hold the sacred text.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We learn, we may fail, or triumph, and the next epoch follows,</p>
  <p>but every new epoch grows from the one previous.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We can&apos;t leap from one place to another,</p>
  <p>we can only move up, or graduate up, or build up, or step up.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>To leap, is to stay a child in an aging body,</p>
  <p>to go up, to grow up, and carry on to no end, is to become an adult.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>In our youth we must learn to stand our ground,</p>
  <p>and anchor ourselves to something that moves us.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>As we age, having followed that path,</p>
  <p>we&apos;ll be standing upon our own mountain,</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A great mountain of personal wisdom,</p>
  <p>where once only a direction lay.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>These mountains rise with each epoch in our life,</p>
  <p>every once in a while we pause, to bring all that we are together - higher.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Epoch by Epoch, we ascend, we can already see the sunshine,</p>
  <p>but our journey comes with no end.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>This is a simple life, first we conform and then break away,</p>
  <p>we become wise, and later in life, our wisdom transforms into Enlightenment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is a road of Adventures, Books, Poems, and Inspirations,</p>
  <p>it has tears of sadness, but in return we grow stronger.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>What it is all for, is to Live a Life of Simple Dignity,</p>
  <p>or rising when we fall, of learning when we get tricked.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Of protecting our bodies and minds, and growing stronger,</p>
  <p>of adding to our existing body of wisdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>With each epoch we climb over what we previously thought were our limits,</p>
  <p>As we get up, and stand up, we reach a new plateau.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We rest, we take in the sun of this new height,</p>
  <p>and get busy building higher, and higher.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>None of us begged to be born, we were nothingness,</p>
  <p>and temporarily all these atoms came together to give us, ourselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And eventually, we&apos;ll return to our nothingness,</p>
  <p>and the atoms will disperse, to become parts of other beautiful things,</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>While we are in this state, however, the first and foremost order!</p>
  <p>...is to Thrive, to Grow, to Expand, to Rise, to Build, and to Ascend.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Whether we know it yet or not, the road that we are on, is one.</p>
  <p>It is the same road that our 90 year old selves will wonder about.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>They will go up and down the Epochs, and ask questions.</p>
  <p>there will be some regrets, but we do have a chance to solve them now.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>There will be enough triumph to bring blinding light to all the sadness,</p>
  <p>and the beautiful memories will wipe out all the unimportant things.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>All that stands in the way of our growing up,</p>
  <p>must be pushed aside, growing up is our life.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We must grow up, rise up, all the way up.</p>
  <p>Each and every epoch ahead, demands this.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Our minds require wisdom, wisdom fuels our decision making,</p>
  <p>and our choices dictate all our life ahead.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Life is precious, it is to be lived in Dignity and Authenticity,</p>
  <p>and you are meant to become a Great Being.</p>
