      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The Nearly Impossible Journey Towards World Unity And Peace</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real Education and Cultural Convergence is one sure way towards World Peace,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it requires that all the cultures of the Human Kind grow.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In order to make headway in this exhausting and near impossible Dream,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we have to stop making decisions in the now, and begin thinking in terms of generations.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To think in terms of generations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is to build real educational institutions that make a real positive difference.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">An educational institution that makes a real positive difference,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">provides its students - not with a self serving system of grades - but several independent student made businesses at graduation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is the creation of these businesses,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that will determine what topics of interest the student will reach out for.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In a very small, and restrained part,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the existence of these powerful international institutions is funded by a small temporary percentage of the student earnings.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Unlike today Universities, these institutions are open to all,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they only take enough money to stay in business.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And they server billions of students,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with the express purpose of Noble and Dignified Betterment of Human Kind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No student will ever be expelled,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there will be no grades, no punishment, no records of wrong doing, only successful graduation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Heartbreakingly, our civilization has not yet progressed far enough,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to successfully build these Loving Gigantic Institutions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Humanity is not yet ready to recognize the importance,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">not get it right, as the project would be plagued with liars, pretenders, and failures; hoping for breadcrumbs.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Today, more effort would go into protecting these institutions from liars,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then helping the students transcend their limitations.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Without getting too much into it, as there is too much to waste our time,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">from a very important perspective, heartbreakingly, it is illegal... under US constitution, to provide _all_ children, with universal education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed that,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"the benefits of universal education do not justify a violation of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Which reads,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof..."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our civilization, is not yet ready to embrace real education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">these international institutions would fail to secure stable initial funding.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And with heir importance misperceived as an attack on nationalism, or the spreading of globalism, or some other **** fairy tale,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they would be gutted, and taxed, and lose the meaningless and corrupt status of accreditation, and used as an example of what not to do.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our civilization is not ready to learn,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the hateful and arrogant politicians we elect show us how far behind on good ideas we truly are.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The way education works today,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">creates a very uneven, luck based, dishonest and inauthentic, and in some cases hostile, surface for all the future generations.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Organized education can't yet work,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but there is a way around this, <span>a path of self education that has already been followed countess times before<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A way that revolves around encouraging all people all around the world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to accept the responsibility for their own education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is also the way that will helps them attack poverty by becoming business people,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and it also serves as a way to clear the land for laying down foundations of the real schools.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Schools of today are not teaching us<sup>[2]</sup></span>, <span>they have failed us<sup>[3]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and <span>we are being cheated out of important knowledge and wisdom<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As many of you have realized by now,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we have not, in fact received a real education, it was a m,make believe education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just hard enough to make you feel that you were working hard,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and that your hard won diploma, would lead you out of poverty and towards a beautiful future.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The people that you thought were smarter then you, were not actually smarter than you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they were self-educating independently of the useless materials in school.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The people that became successful, became successful not because of luck,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but because they accepted the responsibility for their own education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Luck. is easy come,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">easy go, it doesn't stick around like Wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">People are confused about what education is,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they think books, Doctors, and Dentists, but those are just their boring jobs, that were a fun challenge to learn for.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real education, is about Knowledge inherited from countless lives found in powerful books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Wisdom gained from living what is life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And above greatness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Greatness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Greatness of Restraint, Greatness of Dignity, Greatness of Nobility, Greatness of Unbreakability, Greatness of Fortitude, Greatness of Courage, Greatness of Honor, Greatness of Love;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and Greatness of Insight; and Greatness of Foresight; and Greatness of Understanding; and Greatness of Authenticity, and Greatness of Heroism; and, then some.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Greatness<sup>[5]</sup></span> is not difficult, it is what Human are meant for,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but it is deliberate, it requires sustained everyday urge to better yourself.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The Wold Schools that I describe,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will bring World Peace, simply by making Humanity Wise.</div>
