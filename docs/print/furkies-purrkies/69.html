  <p>Some adventurers,</p>

  <p>Others,</p>
  <p>runaway from their fathers.</p>

  <p>That is, until the night comes about,</p>
  <p>at which point all the wild creatures come out.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I&apos;ve heard stories of owls swooping down from the air,</p>
  <p>just to rip out whatever is left of a man&apos;s hair.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Then there are the occasional mad deer,</p>
  <p>always shimmy-shammying around like they had a beer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The coyotes are especially frightening,</p>
  <p>they come in groups, flashing their eyes like lightening.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>One time I tried to turn on a flashlight,</p>
  <p>as it turned out - to all the big spider&apos;s delight.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Let me tell ya, It takes a man with a lot of brass,</p>
  <p>not to scream, when a spider crawls out with a huge glowing ass.</p>

  <p>Once, an older lady from a near by camp went to get more booze from her car,</p>
  <p>and then misjudged her distance, and walked back too far.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I was sleeping on the ground in my tiny tent,</p>
  <p>and then all of a sudden she started yelling out in her lost torment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Of course, in the middle of the night, and woods and my sleep,</p>
  <p>she didn&apos;t sound like a lady but rather some huge creepy creep.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>She found her way back, and I am sure they partied hard,</p>
  <p>but not knowing what made all those screams, I slept - on guard.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>Porcupines, oh, you&apos;ve never seen one like I did,</p>
  <p>it was huge, covered in spikes, and really fit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It could outrun a car or two,</p>
  <p>probably, bite a tire and chew.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But then I came across a sign,</p>
  <p>and it turned out that the biggest creature, was not the Porcupine,</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I was always pretty happy that none of the creatures that bite,</p>
  <p>could actually take me down in a single swipe.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But the sign read, <strong>Beware Of Bear</strong></p>
  <p>and that to me was the biggest scare.</p>
