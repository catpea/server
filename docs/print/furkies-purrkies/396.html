      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">You Are Extraordinary, Believe In Your Greatness</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One of the worst things that can happen to a Human Being,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is being tricked into thinking that they are an ordinary person.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Being tricked into thinking that they are not as intelligent as the A+ kids,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or not as good as the ones with rich parents.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The measure of a person comes from within,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and can only be ignited with a deliberate pursuit of Real Knowledge and Real Wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We can all image a person tricked into thinking that they are a worker,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and being worked until old age, just to discover it was all a lie.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">People that trick us this way are many,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a lot of people are constantly searching to simplify their life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That is an awful thing to do and not really that different from manipulating and lying,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they take advantage of people that don't yet know to protest.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Children are taught to keep away from stray dogs and strangers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but there is nobody to tell them that we are born noble and meant to become great.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It would be very difficult for a recruiter to take advantage of an impressionable mind,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">had they been taught that wars and borders are a symptom of not thinking, of lack of wisdom and foresight.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In a world where we are taught that we are noble creatures,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we will become incorruptible, and bullies will be seen as sick.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The difference between being tricked into thinking that we are ordinary,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and being taught and inspired into knowing that we are each mean to become a great being.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Is the key.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The Key to World Peace, to turning money from a noose,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to a tool for flourishing and well being, and growing all the way up.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Without that key, that belief that we are extraordinary,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we have a tendency to retreat and shelter.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">With the key, we develop an unshakable dignity,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and that unbreakable spirit, necessary for change to take root.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Can you see what a massively limiting and corrupting mistake it is,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to live what me may later learn, was not yet life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">While we inherit best from Beloved Thinkers and Inspirational Philosophers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by taking to their books, and narrated versions as well.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>The Beginning<sup>[1]</sup></span> of the awakening to the realization that Human Beings are not ordinary,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is not found in adding more knowledge, but in seeking less complexity.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The beginning is so pleasant, and so beautiful, that it almost seem too good to be true.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the beginning is found in adventure with kin, or kind, out on the world's longest trails.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We each have a capacity to move mountains, but we have to be mindful of it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so that we don't exhaust our power on temporary or fleeting things.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The great power lies within aligning our days in such a way as to imbue each new day,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with the achievements of all the previous days; so that we live each new day with our entire life force.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are an extraordinary creature whose greatness is fulled by Knowledge, Experience, and Wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you are meant to become an Unshakable, Unbreakable, and Unstoppable, Noble and Wise Great Being.</div>
