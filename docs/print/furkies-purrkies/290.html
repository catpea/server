    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Living Life</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Culture switching is the best way to learn, it is about discovering that not only one's own culture is fluid,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but also, that there is no standard culture, just a colorful bouquet.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think most people assume that switching cultures</div>
  <div class="paragraph">means living in some other country for a but moving around is just as good.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The point is not to be glued to a single spot,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but continue adapting to as many as possible.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Moreover, changing the way we live is just as good,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">spending half a year traveling the Appalachian Trail is the most powerful example.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Above all, going to sleep when it gets dark, and rising to watch the sun rise,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is a great treasure, that brings great heath and strength.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Going forward every day, and slowing down to match the pace of nature,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">helps people have long thoughts and connects all their dots together.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Discomfort, is not part of learning and growing, or healing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is just that we must not succumb to fear and imaginary dragons.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Doing new things is not perfect, but it is not discomfort,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">discomfort is when someone is hurting you, or life is crushing you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">These are the situations that require drastic changes,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">not just a set of changes, but a long term series of changes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Some people, presumably at-least armchair psychologists,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">say that we end up using a more logical side of our brain...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But, I am sure that our brains are infinitely more complex than that,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and what is actually going on is that we are leaving a kind of depression behind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One of our main missions in life, is to live it to its fullest because, life is precious,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and that includes living in balance with nature, wisdom, and universe.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And while, I do admit that this sounds a wee bit hokey,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the best way to personally explore ideas behind heath and balance.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Is to try to imagine our elder selves,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">at say, 85 and a half years, young.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is hard to deny that, no one is more connected to the elder you, than you right now,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you can try to project your predispositions and try to imagine what the elder you is like.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our energy is found in balanced living,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we have to move away from stress, and depression, and overwork.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our intelligence, and creativity, our memory, and ability to learn, and read books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">requires that we take really good care of ourselves.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In school and at work, you will find your self facing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">what I would call Profit Optimization.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Mediocre teachers will want a perfect mediocre score,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that is slightly above their last year statistics so that they may show improvement.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The average employer will want you to do more for less,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or to get more out of you, without investing more into you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And that means,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">pushing you past your healthy balance.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Encouraging use of medications that help with temporary memory at school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and whatever pushes you into overwork and over performing at work.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you don't do that,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you will be replaced by someone who is willing to live sick for the minimum you got paid, or less.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Allow me to digress, and say that to deal with both of these issues in a healthy fashion,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you can self-educate and and aim to build a serious of start-ups.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now, when building your companies, you will be tasked with not pushing yourself,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">while it is easier to overwork in short term, it is not worth it in long term.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You need heart, and soul, and long visions and thoughts to craft your own future,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and being stressed, depressed, and overworked will only take those powers away from you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Living healthy should be the easiest thing for you, cramming, overworking, stressing, depressing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and squeezing every last bit of energy out of yourself, aught to be the more difficult path.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just listen to what I am saying;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when you are healthy and in balance with your self, or with nature, whatever you conceive to be:</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are at your most intelligent, and most creative, and strongest self,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you are also most beautiful, and I am sure at your funniest, in that worst of ways where no one is sure if are joking or dead serious.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One of the ways to connect with your elder self,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is to make them better, is to grant them outrageous gifts from your youth.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even if just to remind them,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">who the boss really is, or to make them smile in wonder.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Great beings often appear slightly odd and confusingly funny, just because of that,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they are sending a message into their own future, to guarantee the health of their elder selves.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Culture switching helps a person become unstuck,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it exposes them to new experiences, and removes old discomforts, and often making them more courageous.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is important to read books, and that means to live in a state that is conducive to inheriting lifetimes of knowledge,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and that state just can't be found at places that aim to push you out of balance for their own profit.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It sounds terrible, but this is just a call to rising, to self balancing, to becoming an independent thinker,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to leaving all influences whether perceptible of obscured, behind you, in a blur of a series of challenges.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">With each new step,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you will learn new things.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">With each new culture,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you will become more illuminated.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And with each Great Endeavor,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you will become, greater.</div>
