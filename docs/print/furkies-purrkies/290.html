  <p>Culture switching is the best way to learn, it is about discovering that not only one&apos;s own culture is fluid,</p>
  <p>but also, that there is no standard culture, just a colorful bouquet.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I think most people assume that switching cultures</p>
  <p>means living in some other country for a but moving around is just as good.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The point is not to be glued to a single spot,</p>
  <p>but continue adapting to as many as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Moreover, changing the way we live is just as good,</p>
  <p>spending half a year traveling the Appalachian Trail is the most powerful example.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Above all, going to sleep when it gets dark, and rising to watch the sun rise,</p>
  <p>is a great treasure, that brings great heath and strength.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Going forward every day, and slowing down to match the pace of nature,</p>
  <p>helps people have long thoughts and connects all their dots together.</p>

  <p>Discomfort, is not part of learning and growing, or healing,</p>
  <p>it is just that we must not succumb to fear and imaginary dragons.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Doing new things is not perfect, but it is not discomfort,</p>
  <p>discomfort is when someone is hurting you, or life is crushing you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>These are the situations that require drastic changes,</p>
  <p>not just a set of changes, but a long term series of changes.</p>

  <p>Some people, presumably at-least armchair psychologists,</p>
  <p>say that we end up using a more logical side of our brain...</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But, I am sure that our brains are infinitely more complex than that,</p>
  <p>and what is actually going on is that we are leaving a kind of depression behind.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>One of our main missions in life, is to live it to its fullest because, life is precious,</p>
  <p>and that includes living in balance with nature, wisdom, and universe.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And while, I do admit that this sounds a wee bit hokey,</p>
  <p>the best way to personally explore ideas behind heath and balance.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Is to try to imagine our elder selves,</p>
  <p>at say, 85 and a half years, young.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is hard to deny that, no one is more connected to the elder you, than you right now,</p>
  <p>you can try to project your predispositions and try to imagine what the elder you is like.</p>

  <p>Our energy is found in balanced living,</p>
  <p>we have to move away from stress, and depression, and overwork.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Our intelligence, and creativity, our memory, and ability to learn, and read books,</p>
  <p>requires that we take really good care of ourselves.</p>

  <p>In school and at work, you will find your self facing,</p>
  <p>what I would call Profit Optimization.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Mediocre teachers will want a perfect mediocre score,</p>
  <p>that is slightly above their last year statistics so that they may show improvement.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The average employer will want you to do more for less,</p>
  <p>or to get more out of you, without investing more into you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And that means,</p>
  <p>pushing you past your healthy balance.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Encouraging use of medications that help with temporary memory at school,</p>
  <p>and whatever pushes you into overwork and over performing at work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>If you don&apos;t do that,</p>
  <p>you will be replaced by someone who is willing to live sick for the minimum you got paid, or less.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Allow me to digress, and say that to deal with both of these issues in a healthy fashion,</p>
  <p>you can self-educate and and aim to build a serious of start-ups.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Now, when building your companies, you will be tasked with not pushing yourself,</p>
  <p>while it is easier to overwork in short term, it is not worth it in long term.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You need heart, and soul, and long visions and thoughts to craft your own future,</p>
  <p>and being stressed, depressed, and overworked will only take those powers away from you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Living healthy should be the easiest thing for you, cramming, overworking, stressing, depressing,</p>
  <p>and squeezing every last bit of energy out of yourself, aught to be the more difficult path.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Just listen to what I am saying;</p>
  <p>when you are healthy and in balance with your self, or with nature, whatever you conceive to be:</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You are at your most intelligent, and most creative, and strongest self,</p>
  <p>you are also most beautiful, and I am sure at your funniest, in that worst of ways where no one is sure if are joking or dead serious.</p>

  <p>One of the ways to connect with your elder self,</p>
  <p>is to make them better, is to grant them outrageous gifts from your youth.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Even if just to remind them,</p>
  <p>who the boss really is, or to make them smile in wonder.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Great beings often appear slightly odd and confusingly funny, just because of that,</p>
  <p>they are sending a message into their own future, to guarantee the health of their elder selves.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>Culture switching helps a person become unstuck,</p>
  <p>it exposes them to new experiences, and removes old discomforts, and often making them more courageous.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is important to read books, and that means to live in a state that is conducive to inheriting lifetimes of knowledge,</p>
  <p>and that state just can&apos;t be found at places that aim to push you out of balance for their own profit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It sounds terrible, but this is just a call to rising, to self balancing, to becoming an independent thinker,</p>
  <p>to leaving all influences whether perceptible of obscured, behind you, in a blur of a series of challenges.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>With each new step,</p>
  <p>you will learn new things.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>With each new culture,</p>
  <p>you will become more illuminated.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And with each Great Endeavor,</p>
  <p>you will become, greater.</p>
