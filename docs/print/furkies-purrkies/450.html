      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Dr. Fancy Pants: No Expedition Too Small</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I firmly believe we are each born a Scientist,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when I was little - just as soon as I could scribble I begun writing a book entitled Kosmos.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And when the bullies came,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I started a garden where I was hoping to make a crabcherryapplegrass tree, by splicing some random branches together, some of which might have been dead and dry.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And, I could say many awful words in different languages,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and I remember the movie poster from which I slowly learned the f-word, like it was yesterday.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I use the f-word at least three times a week,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and only to crow the worst divers, I am proud to know my words, I never mean ill will.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even though I never became a Professional,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I always ignored people telling me that I can't do something.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Only once did I have a tiny little doubt,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and this was about mathematics - but only lyke for a second - I quickly realized that everyone was just memorizing everything, and that was not learning.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My expeditions are absolutely my greatest venture,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">not once in my whole life, did I ever go for a walk - like at all - it was always a challenging expedition.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And where I was cursed with but a short stretch of a road - which almost never happened,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then I would take to philosophy and unsolved mysterious-mysteries.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For example, did you know that the big feet of the big foot,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is just how the sun melts footprints in the snow, yup - I cracked that case too (though I am unwilling to admit how old I was.)</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I still remember my most frightening mystery,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it happened on a lonely hill, by a couple of trees I called rain makers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I was walking around the rim of a steep drop-off,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">got lured in by some fancy sticks, and possibly a small passage.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And all of a sudden I heard footsteps,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and get this, footsteps all-a-freaking-round-me, everywhere.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It was like medieval warriors rushing to battle me,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I had no idea what was going on.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It turned out to be deer,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but it wasn't just any deer, they were huge, magnificent, majestic, movie deer, with huger antlers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They didn't just frighten me,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they also manged to make me feel ugly, somehow.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But... not once did I skip an adventure,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">not once did I skip an expedition.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Not once did I forget to bring something I needed,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I lived the life of a great explorer.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And a little scientist,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for many years, if not decades I would celebrate New Years by writing a small but nice computer program.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I reached the height of my programming,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when I got my early Sharp Zaurus SL-5500 and ended up writing bunch of cute little Perl scripts, without getting off the couch.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is a little know fact that back in my Flash days,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was slowly becoming a generative artist, I remember creating a book of trees, it is a simple program with classy results.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I also created a book of shadows by automating Poser,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a program that deal with human figures and shadow, it was a shadow reference book for artists.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Yes, these are all small experiments,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but there were m,any of them, I built flimsy horses out of sticks and screws based on <span>Theo Jansen's Ideas<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I made so many miniature slingshots that to this day,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am still an expert at making them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Teachers hated this,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">everyone hated this, always; but I never listened, not when I was little, not when I grew older.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Learning is what it is all about,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we must never never give in.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You must never let the teachers scar you with grades,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">never let the bullies crush you, threats are always temporary, and they always pass.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Learning is forever,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I said to myself this morning that I forgot more than I know - but that is a dumb thing to say - and I didn't quite meant to be serious.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You never forget what you learn,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">all the new stuff needs that other stuff to stand on top of.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Never stop learning,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">never let anyone stop you from learning.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Every new lesson is a new path,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that will expand your universe.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We each have a Scientist, and an Artist, and an Inventor in our soul,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and we can feel that the most when we are little, but then we must hand on to that, especially as we start growing up.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You never really become a grow up,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is just that you grow wiser, each day.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No lesson is too foolish,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">no expedition too small.</div>
