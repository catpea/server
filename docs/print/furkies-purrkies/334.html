      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Grades Are Not A Measure Of Your Worth Or Intelligence</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have to be really careful with believing in what schools can do for us,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and no matter what we need to accept the responsibility for our own education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our knowledge is too sacred,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to entrust somebody else with.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Listen to the top selling Audio Books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you can find them at the Library for free.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Learning at your own pace and in the sequence that fits you best,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">should give you a really good idea of what real education is like.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We can't sit down in class,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and expect to become wise.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">School is great for memorizing language,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and memorizing how to write, and spell.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Because these things are _meant_ to be memorized,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">stored within our memory for recall.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But a formula is a little machine,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a little engine, or program.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It must be taken apart,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">explained, studied and understood.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The teacher must be able to show you how fascinating it is,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if they can't do that, then they are not a teacher.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If a teacher tricks you into thinking you are just not smart,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that is a setup.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They are kind-of neutralizing you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">preventing you from standing up and saying:</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"But you only made us memorize it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and that is not learning, that is just forcing us into acting like we have learned.."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They rarely need to go this far, they learn from each other to be cunning,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they will just threaten you with failing the class, if you don't memorize.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When a teacher says "study for the test tomorrow",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that is them encouraging you to memorize it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To study something requires months and years, journals and research,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to tell you to study for something tomorrow or next week, is an insult.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They are asking you to cram,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to memorize.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This right here is the reason why you need to read books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">these people are making you pretend that you are getting an education, so that they get a paycheck.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And this is completely flying over your head,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you have to be smarter than the teachers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even if only to stop stressing about classes and grades,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you have to be good to yourself.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Reading a few dozen books will help you get a better picture of the world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you'll be able to see that very few things actually work.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And just for that tiny reason alone,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there is no way schools are an exception.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Please,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">don't let anybody trick you into thinking that you are not smart.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are all equally intelligent,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and we all greatly enjoy learning and adventure.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Stress, will however prevent you from learning,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because learning requires healthy curiosity and joy of life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have to be free to actually to find you path,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and your sequence of curiosities, and slow down to find the pace at which you learn.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Please, if you have bad grades, that just means you are naturally rejecting brainless memorization,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that does not mean you are unintelligent.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That actually means that you find inner-workings of formulas and systems,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">delightful and most enlightening.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As we grow more mature, we all develop a tendency to prefer real knowledge over memorized gibberish,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">people with bad grades tend to be more mature than those who accept memorization without any discomfort.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If the world did trick you that you are less intelligent than the "smart kids",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you'll be OK, but you can't allow things like this to be happening in your life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A considerable part of meaning of life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is to become a Great Being by leaving behind meaningful and lasting contributions to those who come after you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You can't let people interfere with your education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or your self esteem, your intelligence, or your well being, those things are sacred.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Please, go to your library and begin listing to all the popular Audio Books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">listen to all the best selling non-fiction, the best sellers usually hold the best wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Help the others, make sure no other student is tricked into thinking that they aren't smart,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">even is they say that they know this, they will still appreciate the reminder.</div>
