  <p>I like riding around on my bicycle,</p>
  <p>but today I felt like an icicle.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Just got back from this years first long ride,</p>
  <p>I feel cheerful and mighty satisfied.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>All the cute creatures are still there,</p>
  <p>and thankfully, still no signs of angry bear.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Riding alone, I reminisced about a warmer time,</p>
  <p>when a car slowed down and screamed like there was some crime.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I had no idea what they were saying,</p>
  <p>but waiving their hands, it was a danger they were portraying.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But, I was like, &quot;Oh, whopped do, who knows...&quot;</p>
  <p>and in the next moment, I had to take off most of my clothes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><img src="../../image/md-poetry-0068-noclothes.jpg" alt="No Clothes"></div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I have never been in such great rain,</p>
  <p>it was like standing next to a burst water main.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I loved it, the rain was fragrant, fresh and warm,</p>
  <p>I could never call that a storm.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The sun came out instantly, I was like &quot;K. rain, thanks, bye.&quot;,</p>
  <p>and then I had to hang out all my clothes to dry.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The 13 mile ride back home was full of mud,</p>
  <p>I had to lift my legs, and will my bike across a flood.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>I am so glad no one will ever know about this,</p>
  <p>but still, these are the memorable moments</p>
  <p>that make me reminisce.</p>
