    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Authenticity and Pursuits of Excellence are a fine method,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for resisting the overwhelming power of Cultural Indoctrination.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is easy to trick ourselves that we know enough, that we will do enough,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but to test ourselves we only need to see if we can write a meaningful book.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But there is other trickery at play,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">one that is related to the level of our knowledge, and the content of the culture we grow up in.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is a more formidable problem,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">thus the Thinking Tools are more complex.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Authenticity exposes weakness and lessons,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and The Culture of Pursuits of Excellence, sets us on an adventure of the lifetime.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The Problem of Knowing Enough.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We tend to make decisions that result in not what we wanted,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">our intent suffers from not enough experience, knowledge and information.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A good abstract example of that,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is navigating dark woods.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Without a map we maybe headed in the wrong direction,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with a map; we may turn around and begin moving in the opposite one.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The more we know, the better we navigate,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a powerful intermediate solution to this problem is Non-Fiction Audio Books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Memoirs and Biographies about Growing Up and Learning.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The Problem of Content of Culture, more specifically Cultural Indoctrination.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Is in observations of the surrounding world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and hopes of living a meaningful existence in harmony with it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If we are taught a falsehood about the world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we will make decisions, of our own free will, that will be wrong.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A good example of that is the propaganda of warring tribes or nations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">teaching their children that the other is evil.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is very difficult to catch ourselves as being under control of a cultural falsehood,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we tend to accept the culture we are born into, as a source of absolute truth.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let me give you an example,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that your mind will actively work to reject, paragraph by paragraph.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When we went to school we were convinced it would teach us knowledge,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">even though nearly every month there was more and more evidence to the contrary.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No matter what,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we still believed.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We saw unfair grading, bullies and violence, hate, racism and indifference,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we saw that everyone was cheating by cramming, and that teachers loved it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We saw many kids get into drugs and alcohol,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">some of us even foresaw that some of the staff were predators looking for prey.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We accepted grades,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and we accepted it as a measure of our intelligence.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We accepted grades, knowing about cheating by cramming, and knowing about unfair grading,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we still though of ourselves as B or C, or D level humans.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In the end we saw, that everything we gained, we gained by working on our own,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and finally noticed that a diploma didn't even guarantee a well-paying job.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Late on in life many of us noticed that many schools are not a source of knowledge,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but a source of regret, a force of erosion.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Many of us became so confused, that we immediately assumed we were wrong,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and never said a single bad thing about schools.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The <span>tragedy of organized education<sup>[1]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is a good example of the Overwhelming Power of Cultural Indoctrination.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now let us take a look at Authenticity and Pursuits of Excellence with a bit more detail, as those two combine to help with both</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Problem of Knowing Enough and The Problem of Cultural Indoctrination.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Authenticity.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Accept authenticity the way you accepted Dignity, and Goodness, and Class.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that's how you become more sensitive to inconsistencies that are surrounding you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Next time you ask yourself, am I classy, and I a good person, am I a dignified person,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">also ask; am I an authentic person that lives an authentic existence.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Dignity, and Goodness, and Class, are things we strengthen in our Soul and Heart as we grow,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">now add Authenticity to help you see a little bit better.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Often times when our intent is noble, but results end up wrong,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it means that we were purposefully misled.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">With Authenticity in our Heart,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we get an extra moment to ourselves.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In context of education, if a teacher is forcing you to cram for tests so you get good grades,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you are more likely to walk out and talk to the Dean, or Principal.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No longer will you feel compelled to cram,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because it will feel inauthentic.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">After all, faking test results by means of cramming, or temporary memorization,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is not what you intended when signing up for school, it is something you were pressured into.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Authenticity presents many more challenges in life than just going along with everyone else,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because one of the strong points of moving along with the surrounding culture, is that it is easier to move with the flow and play by the rules.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">However, the price we pay for ease,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is that we don't really learn anything, we just pretend to learn.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Pursuits of Excellence are by definition difficult, and challenging, however they result in Real Knowledge, a Real Functional Education.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You start with Audio Books, Video Lectures, Survey Courses and learn with whatever means are at your disposal.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is more challenging, than cramming for tests,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but this is not difficult because you are working with material you love, with knowledge that touches and moves you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The reward for Standing in Relentless Pursuit of Excellence and Authentic Achievement,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is the Complete Knowledge of the subject you Love.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If that takes you to a Science, Medical, Technology or Engineering School,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or a <span>Startup Accelerator<sup>[2]</sup></span>, or your own company from zero.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Then you are faced with a much smaller challenge, there is no more cramming, or pretending,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as you are now filled with Athletic Knowledge from across thousands of books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Knowledge that you connected in a sequence that served you best,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and at a pace that helped you retain most.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Authenticity and Pursuits of Excellence,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">put us on a path to becoming Wiser Beings.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They will help you see in a world obscured by indoctrination,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or one that lacks real education.</div>
