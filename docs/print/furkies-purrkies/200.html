  <p>Authenticity and Pursuits of Excellence are a fine method,</p>
  <p>for resisting the overwhelming power of Cultural Indoctrination.</p>
</div>

  <p>It is easy to trick ourselves that we know enough, that we will do enough,</p>
  <p>but to test ourselves we only need to see if we can write a meaningful book.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But there is other trickery at play,</p>
  <p>one that is related to the level of our knowledge, and the content of the culture we grow up in.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>This is a more formidable problem,</p>
  <p>thus the Thinking Tools are more complex.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Authenticity exposes weakness and lessons,</p>
  <p>and The Culture of Pursuits of Excellence, sets us on an adventure of the lifetime.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

<div class="section">
  <p>The Problem of Knowing Enough.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We tend to make decisions that result in not what we wanted,</p>
  <p>our intent suffers from not enough experience, knowledge and information.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A good abstract example of that,</p>
  <p>is navigating dark woods.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Without a map we maybe headed in the wrong direction,</p>
  <p>with a map; we may turn around and begin moving in the opposite one.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The more we know, the better we navigate,</p>
  <p>a powerful intermediate solution to this problem is Non-Fiction Audio Books,</p>
  <p>Memoirs and Biographies about Growing Up and Learning.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The Problem of Content of Culture, more specifically Cultural Indoctrination.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Is in observations of the surrounding world,</p>
  <p>and hopes of living a meaningful existence in harmony with it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>If we are taught a falsehood about the world,</p>
  <p>we will make decisions, of our own free will, that will be wrong.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A good example of that is the propaganda of warring tribes or nations,</p>
  <p>teaching their children that the other is evil.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is very difficult to catch ourselves as being under control of a cultural falsehood,</p>
  <p>we tend to accept the culture we are born into, as a source of absolute truth.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Let me give you an example,</p>
  <p>that your mind will actively work to reject, paragraph by paragraph.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>When we went to school we were convinced it would teach us knowledge,</p>
  <p>even though nearly every month there was more and more evidence to the contrary.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>No matter what,</p>
  <p>we still believed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We saw unfair grading, bullies and violence, hate, racism and indifference,</p>
  <p>we saw that everyone was cheating by cramming, and that teachers loved it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We saw many kids get into drugs and alcohol,</p>
  <p>some of us even foresaw that some of the staff were predators looking for prey.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We accepted grades,</p>
  <p>and we accepted it as a measure of our intelligence.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We accepted grades, knowing about cheating by cramming, and knowing about unfair grading,</p>
  <p>we still though of ourselves as B or C, or D level humans.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>In the end we saw, that everything we gained, we gained by working on our own,</p>
  <p>and finally noticed that a diploma didn&apos;t even guarantee a well-paying job.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Late on in life many of us noticed that many schools are not a source of knowledge,</p>
  <p>but a source of regret, a force of erosion.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Many of us became so confused, that we immediately assumed we were wrong,</p>
  <p>and never said a single bad thing about schools.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCbdS4hSa0s">tragedy of organized education</a>,</p>
  <p>is a good example of the Overwhelming Power of Cultural Indoctrination.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Now let us take a look at Authenticity and Pursuits of Excellence with a bit more detail, as those two combine to help with both</p>
  <p>The Problem of Knowing Enough and The Problem of Cultural Indoctrination.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Authenticity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Accept authenticity the way you accepted Dignity, and Goodness, and Class.</p>
  <p>that&apos;s how you become more sensitive to inconsistencies that are surrounding you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Next time you ask yourself, am I classy, and I a good person, am I a dignified person,</p>
  <p>also ask; am I an authentic person that lives an authentic existence.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Dignity, and Goodness, and Class, are things we strengthen in our Soul and Heart as we grow,</p>
  <p>now add Authenticity to help you see a little bit better.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Often times when our intent is noble, but results end up wrong,</p>
  <p>it means that we were purposefully misled.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>With Authenticity in our Heart,</p>
  <p>we get an extra moment to ourselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>In context of education, if a teacher is forcing you to cram for tests so you get good grades,</p>
  <p>you are more likely to walk out and talk to the Dean, or Principal.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>No longer will you feel compelled to cram,</p>
  <p>because it will feel inauthentic.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>After all, faking test results by means of cramming, or temporary memorization,</p>
  <p>is not what you intended when signing up for school, it is something you were pressured into.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Authenticity presents many more challenges in life than just going along with everyone else,</p>
  <p>because one of the strong points of moving along with the surrounding culture, is that it is easier to move with the flow and play by the rules.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>However, the price we pay for ease,</p>
  <p>is that we don&apos;t really learn anything, we just pretend to learn.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Pursuits of Excellence are by definition difficult, and challenging, however they result in Real Knowledge, a Real Functional Education.</p>
  <p>You start with Audio Books, Video Lectures, Survey Courses and learn with whatever means are at your disposal.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>This is more challenging, than cramming for tests,</p>
  <p>but this is not difficult because you are working with material you love, with knowledge that touches and moves you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The reward for Standing in Relentless Pursuit of Excellence and Authentic Achievement,</p>
  <p>is the Complete Knowledge of the subject you Love.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>If that takes you to a Science, Medical, Technology or Engineering School,</p>
  <p>or a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=What+is+a+Startup+Accelerator">Startup Accelerator</a>, or your own company from zero.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Then you are faced with a much smaller challenge, there is no more cramming, or pretending,</p>
  <p>as you are now filled with Athletic Knowledge from across thousands of books.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Knowledge that you connected in a sequence that served you best,</p>
  <p>and at a pace that helped you retain most.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Authenticity and Pursuits of Excellence,</p>
  <p>put us on a path to becoming Wiser Beings.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>They will help you see in a world obscured by indoctrination,</p>
  <p>or one that lacks real education.</p>
