  <p>Good to see you, my Enormous Old Friend,</p>
  <p>how long has it been now?</p>

  <p>You haven&apos;t aged a day,</p>
  <p>and as promised I grew in Wisdom, and Strength, and I maybe a bit Taller.</p>

  <p>When I came to America,</p>

  <p>The Bridge, Lady Liberty, and the Old Twins</p>
  <p>kept me company.</p>

  <p>The New York County Supreme Court was my only other friend,</p>
  <p>and I still love her dearly, but we don&apos;t speak anymore.</p>
</div>

  <p>I wanted to be a Judge,</p>
  <p>a Philosopher King as I used to think of them - but I think better now.</p>

  <p>and I will wear my suit,</p>
  <p>and I will wear those shoes that the lawyers went up and down the stairs in - back in 96.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I will read her words again,</p>
  <p>&quot;THE TRUE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IS THE FIRMEST PILLAR OF GOOD GOVERNMENT&quot;,</p>
  <p>But if she could speak, I&apos;d ask about Fair Starts, Prevention, and Rehabilitation, now.</p>

  <p>I made a little pilgrimage after the Twins Feel,</p>
  <p>I went to see if all was healing properly, and it was,</p>
  <p>workers were preparing the site for what would become the Freedom Tower.</p>

  <p>The things I&apos;d ponder about back then were supremely simple.</p>

  <p>Like, &quot;When is it going to stop raining&quot;, and,</p>

  <p>Mostly, I would sit there quietly,</p>
  <p>watch the occasional jogger.</p>
