      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">You Have No Limits</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Fake schooling and the resulting lack of education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">not only hold us back and propagate misery but will destabilize a nation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But the problems are far more complicated,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for one there are very few real criminals, most were just warped by lack of school.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real schools, have the ability,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to prevent a person from committing a crime.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">On top of that, upon committing a crime,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if prisons were turned to special need schools, we could help almost everyone.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real schools are not that complex,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">plus they can use poverty to their advantage.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">By presenting students with a way out of poverty that fits them,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the students will be put in a position where they will want to learn particular things.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That's how real education works,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is not about tests an memorization, but need, imagination, triumph and challenge.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Be it a misguided voter, a desperate student, or someone blinded by fear and anger and poverty,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">schools are all there really is, it is the greatest hope and dream.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What we call a school today, is not a school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is a collective fantasy that hands the teachers a paycheck, and the students a diploma.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our cognitive biases make it so that we go along with it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there are people out there who hold up a diploma they crammed for and truly believe they are an engineer.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is probably similar to when a person commits a crime,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they say "This is is this is where I finally become free", but that is only cartoon reality.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A college diploma does not mean that the student is educated,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and when deans are pressed they will say, "We discouraged cramming".</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And when everyone is pressed to own up,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the mother of the boy who stole,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the engineer's professor,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the engineer and the student,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and that so called criminal,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">the men who approve textbooks,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">those who pray to fairy-tales in hopes of saving nations they mistakenly destroyed,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">and the prime ministers, and royalty,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">popes and cardinals,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the congresses, and the president,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">and the men who nearly destroyed this nation by the practice of "enhanced interrogation",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and those who ignored climate change and might have done a lot worse than torture,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">and those who are glad, that we all forgot,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that we have all pointed intercontinental ballistic missiles at each other,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">all the major cities, all of them, every family, every future.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All they will say is this:</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"I was JUST following orders."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"I JUST didn't know."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"HOW was I supposed to know?"</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is what fake education results in,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this is the "fake it until you make it" pattern of behavior.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The solution to it all is books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">books that those of us who are good at narration,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">read for others who aren't very good at reading.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Teams of students, ganging up together to record books, with laughter, and foolishness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and dammit, sometimes adding whole new chunks to them, to make the dry parts more interesting.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And sharing, with everyone,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">everywhere.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Laughter is the ultimate seal of authenticity,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that something is worth our time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once the world awakens to the realization that students should make the lectures,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">driving them with collective curiosities and inspirations, and sharing them for free.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Kids will want to watch them,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they will want to see what happens next.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Can you imagine a set of lectures by students working to bring back Pixel Art Games,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">lectures on the subject of Color Theory, Trigonometry, Calculus, Music Composition, and even woodworking for the arcade cabinets.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Can you see what having that full vision do to a young mind,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">how inspiring it is to see the classroom succeed in turning out, one game after another, and making a pretty penny too.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real schools combine with reality,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they are both an introduction to the real world and a future extension of it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I know that all of this is a lot to take in,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is a description of the biggest of our problems,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the middle of our solutions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The beginning is much simpler than that,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the beginning starts off like every superhero origin story ever told.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You build up your power,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you armor.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You pick up your first book, your second book, your third book,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Metamorphosis, Walden, Cosmos, Into The Wild.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Sagan, Bryson, Thoreau, Kafaka, Krakauer, Kant, Nietzche,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Dawkins, Harris, Hitchens, Dennett, and countelss others.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">With each book you hear, you inherit you inherit the wisdom of the author,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">just like that, straight up data transfer,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and re-listening to the same audio books or lectures makes them even more powerful.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It takes a few years to take it all on,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but before you know it, your own idea synthesis kicks in.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You'll be able to feel the world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and feel the fear of the fakers, and pretenders.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You'll be able to see the paths of change,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that the world needs so that it may continue growing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You'll be able to connect, restore, repair, and resume,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the thoughts of all great beings from across all the ages.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your intelligence is not set in stone, it is flexible,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">your mind is there to help you become more and more intelligent.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The more you know, the faster you learn more,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the wiser and more intelligent you become.</div>
