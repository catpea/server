    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Worthwhile Wisdom: Do Not Assume You Are Like Everybody Else</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are alike biologically,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and socially we are a single family.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Intellectually,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we are each unique.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Boys thinking that beer is a rite of passage, or a person assuming that they belong to a particular religion,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are both examples of making the mistake, of thinking, that we are like others.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are nothing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">like the others, nothing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The price Humanity pays for this mistake,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is the tragic repetition of all the other mistakes, including those that should never be repeated.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are nothing like the others,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a conscious creature is by definition, unique and free.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is wisdom that Humanity transfers between generations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in the shape of the mainstream culture, and it is good to learn from.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is a wisdom that the majority votes on,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by doing things that they most fulfillment and happiness in.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But not everything in the mainstream is correct,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and it is your job to remove the things that are not worthy of you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Often times, all it takes, is asking,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">what if I was born somewhere else, or what would the Earth look to imaginary great beings from Mars.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Loneliness and isolation are torture,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but cheaply belonging somewhere is not the path out of it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To belong to something,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is to work hard to earn your spot.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Not to say that you have to torture yourself to get there,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as when you aim for greatness, each step is a great reward.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What the small minded don't understand,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is that it is not the aim, and not just the journey, but also your transformation as you adapt to the challenges in your way.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do not make the mistake of thinking that life will end,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there is a possibility that medicine will soon-enough prolong life indefinitely.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You cannot assume, that you are only aiming to be 95 plus,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because that maybe the day you will be granted an opportunity to roll back the clock to when you were 40.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Living life, and making excuses that you will die of old age anyway,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is not how it is done, nor is this a thought _worthy_ of a Noble Human.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have to grow your own way,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you have to recognize that you are perfectly unique.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do listen to the mainstream,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as the choices that billions of people across countless cultures make are often very wise choices.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do not try to join a group,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">of hold up one - that you were merely born into - above all others.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The groups that you want to belong to, deal with Human Greatness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they require knowledge, wisdom, and greatness of heart.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even if humans never invent medicine to indefinitely prolong life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you are still charged with becoming immortal by leaving a clear legacy of future generations.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Humanity has not yet progressed to a level where it can slow down or stand still,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it must continue bettering it self, it must continue developing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The only way that Humanity can truly progress,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is when every human being accepts the responsibility for Real Education and Meaningful Knowledge, and Wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That means you are tasked with becoming a Great Being,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and you will not develop your greatness by merely following.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That Greatness that the World, and the Future, and our Human Family, is asking of you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is the highest and noblest expression of your uniqueness that can only stem from a lifetime of relentless pursuit of excellence.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I repeat one more time,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">do not make the mistake of thinking that you are anything like everybody else.</div>
