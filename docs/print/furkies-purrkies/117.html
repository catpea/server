  <p>In the beginning we discover our Universal Self,</p>
  <p>the Being we are, regardless, of what Culture or Place we are born into.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Then we set an aim, by asking our Elder Selves what heir regrets are,</p>
  <p>the more we advance forward the more we become Ourselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The less regrets our Elder Selves have,</p>
  <p>the more we become in harmony with ourselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The Way Of The Warrior, is a self correcting path,</p>
  <p>each time we advance we become stronger, wiser, and more powerful.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Frame after frame, as time ticks away, and our minds and bodies grow,</p>
  <p>we near, and finally become; our Elder Selves.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We arrive with Certainty of Knowing that the path we traveled was our own,</p>
  <p>that we are in Harmony with Universe, that all our Senses are Finely Tuned.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>In moving forward we don&apos;t need to ask what life is for,</p>
  <p>Life is for the Living, for those who grow and advance forward.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>There cannot be any real regrets as we had decades to avoid them,</p>
  <p>and whatever obstacles there were, we never lost our way.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The Final Aim, is to rise all the way up, and become a Great Being,</p>
  <p>to build a legacy of Wisdom and Good Ideas, Lessons Worth Sharing, and Moving Inspiration.</p>
