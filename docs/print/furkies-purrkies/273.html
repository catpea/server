  <div class="paragraph">Wisdom, is our Universal Language,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">imagine two wise beings from nations that dislike each other.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is nothing but admiration,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the wish to share, and communicate.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">While we all know some English,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there is a lot those two have to say to each other.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One dreams about rebuilding the United States,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as The United States of The World.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The Other wants to look into every corner,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to be certain that mis-education is eating the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There cannot be dislikes here,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">only Love and Understanding, in Wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Wisdom calls to Love,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Everywhere.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Without wisdom a Police officer will unravel into a thug,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with wisdom, disobey orders and protect those who fight for goodness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Without wisdom, children made to become soldiers, will kill each other,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with wisdom, they will turn right around and look their fathers, and commanders in the eyes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Without wisdom politicians will fuel tensions among the nations of the world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with wisdom, they will immediately dismantle nuclear weapons and ban war, not just unethical weapons.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Without wisdom religious leaders divide the world and create open wounds that will never heal,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in wisdom, they will rise up against human rights violations and become popularizes of science and reason.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Without wisdom leaders will see criminals as "needing to be brought to heel",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with wisdom, they will see children who never had a real chance at the good life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Without wisdom, agencies claiming to protect nations will subvert democracy and destroy the nations they were sworn to protect,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with wisdom, they will respectfully prevent the unwise from gaining access to or remaining in positions of authority.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Without wisdom, Earth will be brought to a crisis that will cause mass starvation and call for population control,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with wisdom, businesses that contribute to the Anthropocene Extinction will have to close as profits have no meaning in a world without a future.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Without wisdom, governments will be blind to poverty and prevent generations of children from growing up,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with wisdom, money will be used to help people not erase their minds.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Without wisdom, broken children will become broken men and in poverty of mind parade the color of their skin, or hair as a sign of superiority,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with wisdom we will admire our beautiful uniqueness the wy we admire the colors of each others eyes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The word Philosophy comes from Greek,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it means Love of Wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All wisdom is the same,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there is no bad wisdom, or good wisdom, just Universal wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Wisdom is special,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is like an operating system.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Unlike a computer operating system,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">wisdom independently emerges in sufficiently educated individual beings.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is something that we are predisposed for, by Nature,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Wisdom is the next big step that Humanity must take.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Ineffective Education, and Education driven by propaganda or fantasies,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is hurting our progress forward.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our education is a very delicate process,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">fear of being held back, or bad grades, or being taught fairy tales or falsehoods delays our progress.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Poverty, homelessness, hunger, self medication, and violence,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">prevents us from learning, and we cannot make out way towards wisdom in that state.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have to protect the children from our lack of wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and help them to understand that the only way they can have a future is by means of Wisdom and the Love it entails.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have to encourage children to become Great Beings,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and we have to admit that we can't fix the world because it is a multi-generational project.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The repairs that are required rely on increased levels of Honest and Real Education throughout the world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">no more noise, no more haste, no more grades or levels or division that render subjects incomprehensible.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A real school is marked by real results,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by helping all their students towards Real Wisdom onward to helping them become Great Beings.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Today, very few graduates can see value in retaking all exams that helped them graduate,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and fewer still would be able to get the grades that prove that school was effective.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We confuse our amazing ability to learn, with school's ability to teach,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and we suffer for it, most of us are tricked into thinking that we aren't that smart, but the truth is that the school isn't that good.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do not let schools trick you away from Wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we are an important link in a chain that connect past to the future, we must aim to become wise and teach wisdom as the highest value.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The world will stand still when divided,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when united in wisdom we will rise.</div>
