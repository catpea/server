  <p>Wisdom, is our Universal Language,</p>
  <p>imagine two wise beings from nations that dislike each other.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>There is nothing but admiration,</p>
  <p>the wish to share, and communicate.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>While we all know some English,</p>
  <p>there is a lot those two have to say to each other.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>One dreams about rebuilding the United States,</p>
  <p>as The United States of The World.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The Other wants to look into every corner,</p>
  <p>to be certain that mis-education is eating the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>There cannot be dislikes here,</p>
  <p>only Love and Understanding, in Wisdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Wisdom calls to Love,</p>
  <p>Everywhere.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>Without wisdom a Police officer will unravel into a thug,</p>
  <p>with wisdom, disobey orders and protect those who fight for goodness.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Without wisdom, children made to become soldiers, will kill each other,</p>
  <p>with wisdom, they will turn right around and look their fathers, and commanders in the eyes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Without wisdom politicians will fuel tensions among the nations of the world,</p>
  <p>with wisdom, they will immediately dismantle nuclear weapons and ban war, not just unethical weapons.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Without wisdom religious leaders divide the world and create open wounds that will never heal,</p>
  <p>in wisdom, they will rise up against human rights violations and become popularizes of science and reason.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Without wisdom leaders will see criminals as &quot;needing to be brought to heel&quot;,</p>
  <p>with wisdom, they will see children who never had a real chance at the good life.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Without wisdom, agencies claiming to protect nations will subvert democracy and destroy the nations they were sworn to protect,</p>
  <p>with wisdom, they will respectfully prevent the unwise from gaining access to or remaining in positions of authority.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Without wisdom, Earth will be brought to a crisis that will cause mass starvation and call for population control,</p>
  <p>with wisdom, businesses that contribute to the Anthropocene Extinction will have to close as profits have no meaning in a world without a future.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Without wisdom, governments will be blind to poverty and prevent generations of children from growing up,</p>
  <p>with wisdom, money will be used to help people not erase their minds.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Without wisdom, broken children will become broken men and in poverty of mind parade the color of their skin, or hair as a sign of superiority,</p>
  <p>with wisdom we will admire our beautiful uniqueness the wy we admire the colors of each others eyes.</p>

  <p>The word Philosophy comes from Greek,</p>
  <p>it means Love of Wisdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>All wisdom is the same,</p>
  <p>there is no bad wisdom, or good wisdom, just Universal wisdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Wisdom is special,</p>
  <p>it is like an operating system.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Unlike a computer operating system,</p>
  <p>wisdom independently emerges in sufficiently educated individual beings.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is something that we are predisposed for, by Nature,</p>
  <p>Wisdom is the next big step that Humanity must take.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Ineffective Education, and Education driven by propaganda or fantasies,</p>
  <p>is hurting our progress forward.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Our education is a very delicate process,</p>
  <p>fear of being held back, or bad grades, or being taught fairy tales or falsehoods delays our progress.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Poverty, homelessness, hunger, self medication, and violence,</p>
  <p>prevents us from learning, and we cannot make out way towards wisdom in that state.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We have to protect the children from our lack of wisdom,</p>
  <p>and help them to understand that the only way they can have a future is by means of Wisdom and the Love it entails.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We have to encourage children to become Great Beings,</p>
  <p>and we have to admit that we can&apos;t fix the world because it is a multi-generational project.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The repairs that are required rely on increased levels of Honest and Real Education throughout the world,</p>
  <p>no more noise, no more haste, no more grades or levels or division that render subjects incomprehensible.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A real school is marked by real results,</p>
  <p>by helping all their students towards Real Wisdom onward to helping them become Great Beings.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Today, very few graduates can see value in retaking all exams that helped them graduate,</p>
  <p>and fewer still would be able to get the grades that prove that school was effective.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We confuse our amazing ability to learn, with school&apos;s ability to teach,</p>
  <p>and we suffer for it, most of us are tricked into thinking that we aren&apos;t that smart, but the truth is that the school isn&apos;t that good.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Do not let schools trick you away from Wisdom,</p>
  <p>we are an important link in a chain that connect past to the future, we must aim to become wise and teach wisdom as the highest value.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The world will stand still when divided,</p>
  <p>when united in wisdom we will rise.</p>
