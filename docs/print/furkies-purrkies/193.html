      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Real Education Should Be Your Own Creation</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I had a strange dream, Dear Reader, and at first I thought it was too odd to share,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but now I am thinking, maybe someone you will care.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I dreamt that schools were totally, completely fake,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and that the future of the whole world was at stake.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They became fake because they never could teach,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">no teacher has ever had that kind of reach.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Eventually it just became all make believe,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and school became a real thief.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It stole Knowledge from you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it did it to get teachers paid through.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Most assumed, you wouldn't notice as it kept all blind,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but that early Knowledge was important for the shaping the mind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There was no one in charge, so no whistle was blown,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it was fake it until you make it, each on their own.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They wrote tests to keep scores within range,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to stay below all radars, and to resist any improvement or change.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Expensive text books, purely artificial grades,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">cheap college and expensive university to encourage transfers and trades.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The students who did well,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they had to keep quiet to pass, and anyway, there was no one to tell.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They had to work thrice as hard working with tutors and in groups,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">jumping stupid hoops, making pointless and crazy loops.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And they knew that their success made schools look real and true,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but they had no choice, they had to, graduate and move on through.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Then you got up and said "I am through!,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"how do we fix this - what do we do?"</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That's when I woke up, and thought - "Maybe I should answer this.",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the first thought that came to my mind was "Knowledge is Bliss"</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So I said out loud: "Real Education must be your own creation!",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">after all, is not too hard to find moving inspiration so that you can build your own education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And why do we need a small High School lecture,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">perhaps it is time to change that architecture.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We should listen to a Famous Audio Books or the University Edition,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">perhaps that should become the standard position.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Standardized testing should not lead the way,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is just a test to see if we learning OK.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It seem to me that time has come for change,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">perhaps this is why schools feel so strange.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So, I challenge you, my Dear Reader,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">lead the change you hope to see, become the leader!</div>
