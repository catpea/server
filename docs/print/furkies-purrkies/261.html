    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The first point of failure,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and our first hope for repairs.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Is focus on real education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Schools are graduating students that they failed to educate,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">these children grow into confused adults, lost and looking for belonging.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Why is this tolerated?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let me ask you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">what would happen if we asked all the College Graduates to re-take all their tests from high school on?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Shouldn't people who graduated college easily show improvement to their GPA when re-taking all their tests?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Shouldn't those who graduated, but can't pass their test,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">ask for a refund, or a lawsuit for having been tricked into an impression of education?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is tolerance of these simple stupid problems,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that leads to made up lives of fantasy and eventual blindness towards evil.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you can't pass all the college tests and get a higher GPA than that with which you graduated college,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then you do not have a college education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you can't pass all the high school tests and get a higher GPA than that with which you graduated high school with,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then you do not have a high school education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you can't pass all the middle school tests and get a higher GPA than the one you left middle school with,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then you do not have a middle school education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Not only that, but the way these schools teach and the knowledge they drive into you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">may not be useful; you may not even have a useful education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think we can all agree here,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that we have a problem.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">At the very least,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if your child has bad grades, don't make them feel bad, or unintelligent.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You should move them to a different type of school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">where teachers are interested in educated children rather than turning them into a paycheck.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The reason why it does not occur to parents that schools are not working,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is that they don't have experience with fake institutions, they take them for granted.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They are indoctrinated into a culture where school is good,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and being a worker is great, and it takes a particularly awful person not to achieve anything in life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So what are those achievements?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">How is all that retesting going?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The problem, as you can imagine, is much larger,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">tolerance of fake education is just the beginning.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Above all,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Humanity must grow.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are not allowed to tolerate Human Right Violations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">all human beings are created equal.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All must be granted equal opportunity to real education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in a world that sets them free from poverty, and helps their bodies stay healthy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Nations are not allowed to oppress their people,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">no one has that right.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Nations have a great responsibility to help them to a Real Education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in ways that will ignite a life long adventure across all sciences.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">An opinion cannot stand against a fact,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that is a sign of illness, a small disorder born from fake-education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And our dignity is such, that we must help each other rise,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we are not to tolerate anything that tricks people into believing in options over facts.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Fake education has been behind every evil perpetrated on this planet,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is very much like a virus, it does two things really well, it spreads, and it reinfects.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Whatever beliefs are too hard to let go of,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we only need to place them in history or fantasy books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is wonderful to ponder Ice Giants and Greats Serpents,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but only as a fairy tale, or part of our growing up, not as a fact of life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Fake education, unravels us,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it erases great strides made by great beings, and pulls the younger generations into dark ages.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The fantasies that bring us calm,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">unravel the minds of the younger generations.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The reason we search for mere calm,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is that we ourselves, have been tricked out of real education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All these confusing questions,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are easily treated with made up fantasies.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But that also serves to defeat the purpose,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">of having a Beautiful and Powerful Mind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It makes us weak.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Not a single Human Being is allowed tolerate</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Concentration Camps, Abuse, Child Abuse, Racism and Xenophobia, or Inequality, Hate, or Fake Education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Those of us who chose to relegate ourselves to a life of fantasy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">must also leave the table of public discourse.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Those of us who trade with nations that employ torture,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are not allowed to hold political positions, they simply can't, it is immoral to tolerate this.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Anybody who is delays Humanity's Progress,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">contributes to Human Suffering, to all Suffering, Blindness, Misery, War, and Torture.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our minds are extremely powerful,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and as they are allowed to develop, we will find unity.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We will agree on everything,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as we stabilize amongst each other in wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Government wise, there are no great disagreements,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there is only steady progress, forward.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">On the individual level,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is not that different.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Stress and anger, and sadness yield to Love and Wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">even tragedy turns around a little bit.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">With real education, we don't fall to pieces because something beautiful ended,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but we celebrate that it existed in the first place.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In wisdom, we seek a different class of things,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Nobler Things that come about as a result of our sense of dignity and real education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No longer does anyone go home to a TV dinner,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">suffering from depression, and fear, and loneliness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What creates an educated government, a real government,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is prevention of sickness and poverty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Nobody goes home convinced they are a worker,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or terrified of Human Resources, or or an uneducated "Boss".</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There isn't anybody who will argue against free medical care,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or universal income, or national debt, let it pile up.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The greater the debt that nations of earth owe to the universe,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the higher our level of compassion, empathy and development.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Money is just a job tracking tool,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">on the government level it exists as an abstract idea.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You don't have to worry about Government Debt,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is a good kind of debt, and it has no collectors.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do you see?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Fake Education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is tearing this world apart.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Fake Education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is halting its progress.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is neutering our minds,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is turning us into workers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It makes us ask stupid questions,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and parade stupid ideals and fake political labels.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We can't have a world without real education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the dark ages will swallow us through the various tax exempt churches and imaginary gods.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Irrelevant worthless opinions will have us fighting for nothing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because they are all equally wrong, stupid, and useless.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My friends,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">pay attention to fake education, and everything will work out in the end.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We will find out way to wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we will converge on World Peace in our Wisest and Noblest ideas.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All you have to do, is make it clear to everyone around you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that you will not tolerate fake education, that you are not on that side of history.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Write, Rhyme, Paint, Tag,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">find your way out of fake education and whatever else is pulling you away from wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Hold up you path, and show them the results,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so that others may choose follow.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real Education is marked by wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and it shows real results and contributions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And though your hard earned achievements may already be great today,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">your work is not finished until it brings permanent or lasting contributions towards our eventual convergence on Peace and Wisdom,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Every Human Being on Earth matters,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they are our family.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you accept this great endeavor, many who fell prey to fake education may hate you in their own sickness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but their children and the children of their children will grow up in a world transformed, in no small part by you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are one people, we are all meant to be Truly Educated in Our Beautiful Minds,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and we are all meant to live in safety and in peace looking after one another.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are one people.</div>
