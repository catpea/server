    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Vision</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is not always necessary to accurately map the affairs of the World.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">sometimes all you need is a vision of a better one.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The world is difficult to grasp because people in authority,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">have interests that differ from, the people that vote on them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Furthermore, low quality schools,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will prevent the voter from making correct choices.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The uneducated or misled majority,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will always be incorrect.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is why independent, self education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">be it in addition or as a replacement of the national one is a wise idea.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Independent education is one that is paved with curiosities,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and helped along with top-selling non fiction, including narrated books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Majority of world's top selling books</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are written by well educated and well meaning authors.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Lack of education breeds desperation,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">not only will the voters be confused, but the politicians won't understand them either.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A world where leaders place their needs above the people they swore to represent,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and do the bare minimum for maximum personal gains, is a world that needs vision.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">On the other hand, a well educated, knowledgeable and wise voting majority,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">isn't one to get confused, or become mislead, easily.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A vision is always something that most of humanity has already agreed on,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">though they might have forgotten parts here and there, or worded them differently.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For example:</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Climate Stabilization</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Human Dignity</div>
  <div class="paragraph">World Peace</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Universal Human Rights</div>
  <div class="paragraph">World Disarmament</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Functional Education</div>
  <div class="paragraph">End Of Poverty All Around The World</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Universal Basic Income</div>
  <div class="paragraph">World Unity</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Justice</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Authenticity, and Truth.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As we progress from well-read, to knowledgeable, to wise, and onward to our greatness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we will collect and hold in our hearts many such Hopes and Dreams.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">At first they may seem like words or beautiful ideas,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but as we look into Memoirs, and beloved and honored works of great story tellers, they will become more.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">With a few dozen books a concept that has been lost on leaders of humanity,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will come to life in our hearts.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Rather than trying to flawlessly comprehend the world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">which may not be possible due to too many liars who by definition lack in vision, and are merely responding to stimuli for maximum self gain.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We gain the ability hold up several of our most beloved Aims, Hopes and Dreams,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and ask what are the leaders doing to fulfill them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is much easier to look at a leader's sum of history,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and notice that they have never done anything meaningful for World Peace and Elimination of Poverty, than to await their promises to come true.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We can then ask, if we want to vote on people who do not recognize World Peace and Elimination of Poverty as an aim,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and what those people must be like.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">More importantly, holding a meaningful vision helps us grow up stronger and faster,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">helps us focus our energies and curiosities on things that we become passionate about.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When a wise voting majority becomes passionate about Human Dignity,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the strength that arises from Unity of Vision can easily repair World's Nations and help Humanity Grow.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Without a wise consensus things that are concurring around the world are probably mostly random,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with elections won by those who spend most money on taking on a pleasing shape, and disasters being a predictable result of corruption and shortsightedness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is hard to blame leaders and voters for something as disabling as lack of education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">people who lack knowledge pave their ways with their best intentions, alas Humanity's most beloved works of non-fiction must come first, lest we continue repeating the same old mistakes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is nothing difficult</div>
  <div class="paragraph">about falling in love with Good Ideas,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When we take to Adventures and Books, and a new book surprises us with a like selection of Hopes and Dreams,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we can only discover how connected we all really are, that we are in fact one big family.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What are your Hopes and Dreams?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What is your Vision of The Future Of Humanity?</div>
