      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Programming Is Pretty Funny</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And it isn't about inside jokes,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think it is just that Programmers Are happy people.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">At least when they are not being overprotective,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">of the wrong languages they became good at.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Or supremely questionable program ideas,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that go out of control when they go public.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I've been the butt of a horrible joke once,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was briefly antiquated with a cheerful young lady with an eye for company swag.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And she dragged me along with her mom and husband to one of such event,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and as she was bagging all the refrigerator magnets.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I slowly had a PTSD moment looking over the endless *bleeping* cubicles,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and a gent who instantly saw through that poor woman's magnet addiction, walked up to me curious why I wasn't stealing stuff.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"What do you do?" he asked me,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and I said "I am a computer scientist".</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">His face immediately became rosy and subtly cheerful,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and he slowly backed away to his windows 98 with solitaire sci-ency computer, scientific card came for scientists.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I have since retired from computer scents,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and today, refuse to discuss most of my ideas, perhaps short of how to properly save a file on a multi-process multi-user system.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Curiously, the same damn thing happened,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when I introduced myself as a Professional Philosopher.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That bastard, was unable to control his expression,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and after all the years since, I figured the only kind of Philosopher that he was familiar with...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">...was of the ilk that takes long bathroom breaks,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in his culture those be-throned thinkers are refereed to as Genuine Philosophers - god damn.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I remember his slowly moving away,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and whispering something imperceptibly, alas, with the face of a man that is whispering "So am I"</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That was the last time I took my career seriously,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and with one out of control introduction where I said "I was a shit squishing redneck" before I could stop myself.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This was in context of bravely taking care of Enormous and Dangerous horses,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and to bravely show - that I can really do it - which I couldn't - and to this day I think, that riding animals is too weird and please don't do it if possible.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Since, I have been introducing myself as a Professional Troublemaker,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">which turned out to be a magical way to keep everyone away.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My greatest funny mistake was to crawl out of a dark dungeon of a classroom where programmers were volunteering for charities,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">stepping into the sun to have a photo taken and then uttering "I am going to sparkle like vampires from Twilight" way before I could stop myself.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I later called a boy who called me Superman, Lois,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and just a week ago or two remembered his real name, it is Brian from Microsoft.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">He said "Hey, Superman",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and I was Like "Good morning Lois", I was tired, I was only trying to return a joke, and I only wear the superman shirt, I don't pay attention to the cast of characters.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I admit there are some iffy insider jokes,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but the language of technology is so fantastically broad and ambiguous, that all they cracks fall on deaf ears, no matter how hard you try.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To me this is amazing, because you can load an office meting with so much crap about Male Agents and Explorers of the Internet, and the superhighway that they ride to get to work,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that only the office stonier that stopped giving a damn ages ago, will actually appreciate it for a change, as a kind of sick and sophisticated poetry.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My favorite funny event, is on the internet,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in a <span>speech about organizing code, very true, very funny, and good technology too<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As with all things,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we have to guard against toxic environments.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Advancing in the world of programming,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is as delicate as the most fanciful chocolate sculpture.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There isn't a job that will be respectful of this journey,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it matters not what the promises are.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When you work as a programmer,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you stop being a Fanciful Scientist, and become a distracted one.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But if you can stay on the path of joy, excellence and achievement,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then it is hard no0t to say, that programming isn't somehow an extension of laughter.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I can't explain this,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">at all.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I remember this one programming event where there was only one person on a team,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and it is not that he wasn't able to solve the challenge he was presented with.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">He realistically didn't even attempt to do it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and instead programmed a tiny little thing that would measure microphone volume, and crudely animate Patrick Stewart's bottom chin to it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And this crude little cartoon, damn all the rest,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">was the winner, and the illustration and proof that programming is just as much about laughter as innovation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Last but not least, I must absolutely mention the The <span>Jargon File<sup>[2]</sup></span>, here,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">otherwise somewhat known as the Hacker Dictionary.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The <span>metasyntactic variable<sup>[3]</sup></span> section may just be most reveling,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as it captures the programmer at their most air headed.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I especially like the french "toto, titi, tata, tutu" and gork, which is British,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I myself used the word <span>flarp<sup>[4]</sup></span> in <span>my code just yesterday<sup>[5]</sup></span> and have no regrets.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I also use the word <span>hork<sup>[6]</sup></span> during heavy lifting exercises,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I use it in the "The Incredible Hork horking up a hairball" sense which as far as I can tell if yet to be cataloged.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Single word description of a programmer?</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Throwies<sup>[7]</sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Somber, serious, contemplative on the surface,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but at heart, out of control, colorful, powerful, happy, cheerful, lovers of life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Who do things for reasons, reasons so complex, and layered, and muti-plexed, and out of this world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that very few could ever possibly hope to grasp them, and eventually; none ever will.</div>
