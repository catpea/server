    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Break out of broken education, religions, governments, and status quo,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">do not fear those who secretly fear you, you are a Citizen of the World first.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And be careful, don't let liars make a fool out of you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">poverty is everywhere, and it fractures those who can't handle it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Poverty, frequently causes a poverty of mind,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then all the creativity that makes a person amazing, turns dark.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have to look around, understand the nature of things,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that's exactly what books can give you, and school can never teach you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Self awareness is about gaining some grasp on the layers of influence you are under,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this is so incredibly error prone that people rarely get it right at first.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In their haste for truth they invent things that are not real,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">our inability to see what is holding us down is a nightmare.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But not breaking out, is worse than a nightmare, it is a life sentence,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">victims of cults, bad parenting, strange or frightening beliefs, eventually unravel.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The road to self awareness, is a road to understanding what is real and</div>
  <div class="paragraph">what has been pulled over our eyes to have us serve some purpose.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Sometimes servitude has been so optimized that no one being can spot it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it takes thousands of people and their donations to catch on the fraud.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Therefore, all people must do their travel upwards, out and over, any and all influence,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and books are critical to helping us up, and towards knowledge and wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Freedom is the first and foremost human right, freedom to go anywhere,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">freedom to think anything, freedom to dream and share, freedom of speech and inspiration.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now, look at school, look how easily you accepted your grades,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">how easily you got misled into memorization and got cheated out of learning.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You never noticed school was bad,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">even though it was unfair and often made no sense.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All this evidence, right in front of your eyes,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but you kept believing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My Friends,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you are the New Generations, you are the change you hope to see.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You must practice self awareness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and learn to see through, what you have accepted for granted, and the cultures you were born into.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our task is to Unite Humanity so that there is no more War, no more Poverty, no more Lies,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so that all Darkness is brought into light of Wisdom, and for all to see.</div>
