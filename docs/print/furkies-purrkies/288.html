  <p>Break out of broken education, religions, governments, and status quo,</p>
  <p>do not fear those who secretly fear you, you are a Citizen of the World first.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And be careful, don&apos;t let liars make a fool out of you,</p>
  <p>poverty is everywhere, and it fractures those who can&apos;t handle it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Poverty, frequently causes a poverty of mind,</p>
  <p>then all the creativity that makes a person amazing, turns dark.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You have to look around, understand the nature of things,</p>
  <p>that&apos;s exactly what books can give you, and school can never teach you.</p>

  <p>Self awareness is about gaining some grasp on the layers of influence you are under,</p>
  <p>this is so incredibly error prone that people rarely get it right at first.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>In their haste for truth they invent things that are not real,</p>
  <p>our inability to see what is holding us down is a nightmare.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But not breaking out, is worse than a nightmare, it is a life sentence,</p>
  <p>victims of cults, bad parenting, strange or frightening beliefs, eventually unravel.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>The road to self awareness, is a road to understanding what is real and</p>
  <p>what has been pulled over our eyes to have us serve some purpose.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Sometimes servitude has been so optimized that no one being can spot it,</p>
  <p>it takes thousands of people and their donations to catch on the fraud.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Therefore, all people must do their travel upwards, out and over, any and all influence,</p>
  <p>and books are critical to helping us up, and towards knowledge and wisdom.</p>

  <p>Freedom is the first and foremost human right, freedom to go anywhere,</p>
  <p>freedom to think anything, freedom to dream and share, freedom of speech and inspiration.</p>

  <p>Now, look at school, look how easily you accepted your grades,</p>
  <p>how easily you got misled into memorization and got cheated out of learning.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You never noticed school was bad,</p>
  <p>even though it was unfair and often made no sense.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>All this evidence, right in front of your eyes,</p>
  <p>but you kept believing.</p>

  <p>My Friends,</p>
  <p>you are the New Generations, you are the change you hope to see.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You must practice self awareness,</p>
  <p>and learn to see through, what you have accepted for granted, and the cultures you were born into.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Our task is to Unite Humanity so that there is no more War, no more Poverty, no more Lies,</p>
  <p>so that all Darkness is brought into light of Wisdom, and for all to see.</p>
