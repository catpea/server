      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Are You Really Learning In School?</div>
      <!-- 
      <div class="paragraph"><small>Thursday, November 26th 2020, 6:59:00 pm</small></div>
       -->
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You must not allow your parents to use school as a babysitter,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you must not allow your teachers to trick you into memorization.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Friends and social life, are not an excuse to stay in a bad school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">grab your friends and transfer to something better, or learn on your own.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A bad school diploma does not get you anything,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it only shows people that they can cheat you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">On the other hand dumping a broken school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and transferring to something that does show results makes a world of difference.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For one it will help you experience independence,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with a small measure of discomfort it will help your mind become stronger.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You do not want to work at a company that expect you to waste years on junk lectures,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">your years are precious, each year must find you smarter, stronger, and wiser.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Rejection of pretending to learn,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and not following others will help you grow.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Finding lectures or books that do make you smarter and wiser,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will help you build your own company.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Schools are almost certainly completely broken,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they may be so broken that otherwise normal people may need dangerous medications to pass.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You must resist memorization, and merely getting good at passing tests,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because that is not an real education, that's just basic acting.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is not enough to be in school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or even to have good grades.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You must ask yourself if you are learning for real,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and if what you are learning is useful to you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You must ask yourself if you are seeing real results,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if what you have learned had a positive impact on you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And, you may not be able to find a school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is a real tragedy, we failed you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even if "Fake it until you make it",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">has already turned the world into a brittle cheeto.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is hope,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the hope is in self-education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The people who invented schools and those who made breakthroughs in science,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">begun their self education with a single thread or a question.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They followed a single unbroken line of curiosities and answers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">start with survey courses in Science and Adventure.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To find your beginning search carefully amongst electronics,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">art and sculpture or painting and music, computers, design, programming.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Find the start, get your answers, and rest,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and now resume from where you left off.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No stress here,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">no hard work.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You may only need LEGO Technic and a Raspberry PI kit with sensors,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">maybe a a book about UNIX and a couple of used cheap 3D printers that you splice together.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The only thing that you have to be mindful of,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is keeping a a small Research Journal and Building a Huge Colorful Portfolio.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In fact your portfolio should become one of the main reasons,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for becoming a Graphic Designer and possibly a Web Developer.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">After all, you are capturing your pure joy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and your path of self-education is pure pride.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This kind of coupling, where the want of a beautiful portfolio,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">pushes you towards Design, and possibly programming happens often.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A personal "want" has driven many independent inventors before you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">difference between being taught, and reaching out for knowledge yourself is like night and day.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One takes you to enlightenment, and the other,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">often times towards hating Mondays, waiting for Wednesdays and drinking on Fridays while you wonder if you hate your life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is likely that you will not be accepted to Harvard, not even Peace Corps,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but listen...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">...what does an institution that expects you to sit through worthless mind numbing lectures,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">matter to you, and what does that say about their values and ideals, and deans and the friends and experiences you will encounter there.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Don't bother with things that are not worth your time,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we have to find a way to fix the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have to fix schools, we have to fix poverty,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and damn it, we can't go through our lives with atomic weapons pointed at our families.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Ideas like Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD),</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and banning certain weapons in war but not war it self really show us how young of a civilization we are.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now we race for a High School or College Diploma,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by pretending to learn with memorization while teachers pretend they didn't force us into it for a paycheck.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And deans pretend they have no idea this is going on,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and for the mere stress of massive unforgivable student debt we can get a brand name education that recruiters will void their bowels over.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Oh, and not to mention the 13th Amendment where we can be sent into Legal Slavery,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by downloading the complete questionable works of Lady Gaga in mp3 format, or even just for participating in <span>IPFS<sup>[1]</sup></span> to host our own poems.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is nothing that you will gain from not learning,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">pretending to get educated is just the same as staying uneducated.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Spewing useless gibberish about Trig or powerhouses of the cell,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">only makes people look foolish.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Not only that, but eventually they figure out they got tricked into cramming,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and now not only the look foolish - but heartbreakingly - start feeling it too.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For those of you who did get tricked,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">please just listen to top rated Audio Books in the science, adventure, philosophy and memoir section, it won't take long to catch up.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That whole thing about not being able to learn fast because you are older is fake,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as you get older your bullshit meters get better.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is just that you are no longer willing to waste your time on useless things,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that's why books work but re-taking the GED does not.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But do take it easy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">especially when you are young.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Learn to avoid troublemakers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they are just children with aged faces.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And no there are no exceptions,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and no you are not meant to fill in the blanks for them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The last thing you need is your husband deciding to smoke weed or become a drunk (or worse) 15 years into a marriage because it is now legal,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there is no excuse, no shortcuts in the world of lack of education, we neeeeeeeed wisdom, it is our operating system, it is our everything.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our minds are so powerful,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is so easy to inherit from memoirs.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When combining fascinating books with incredible adventures...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when you find your self atop of an ancient dune in the middle of a nasty storm listening to a life changing book, it all becomes clear.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are underestimating yourself,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">most of us have no idea how powerful we are.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our only problem is that in the face of not knowing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we can be easily mislead and follow useless paths for years or even decades, such as is the case with ineffective education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So speak out,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">don't follow, and don't be silent.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">With the aid of your classroom friends,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">make it clear to your teacher that you would rather study things that are relevant to you-personally, that enlighten your path and produce lasting results that you can build on.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Read books, begin your self education, and develop the skills necessary to express your concerns about the school just turning you into profits,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">fill an auditorium, give speeches and talks in multiple schools; become a leader, an inspiration, a Great Being.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do Not Follow,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Life Is Too Precious, and Your Wisdom Too Important.</div>
