    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Call To Greatness</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Learning has a lot to do with being able to make direct connections</div>
  <div class="paragraph">between what we know, and where we are hoping to get.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you skip a connection,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">learning will become frustrating because you will not be grounded in anything.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are too components at play</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when we are forced to abandon knowledge for memorization.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">On one end it is the threat of failing a class,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this is similar to how criminals are forced to plead guilty, rather than stand up for truth.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And on the other it is being forced into learning something,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that we don't have any base knowledge for, and thus cannot help but t memorize it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you don't have the dots,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you are forced into abandoning learning in favor of just acting like you know, or memorizing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The teacher, gets paid, you get your diploma, the school gets funding,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for as long as you are pretending to learn, everything appears to work.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The threat of failing a class must not force you into memorization,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because that only cheats _you_, and helps the teachers get paid.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are supposed to rise above inauthenticity,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the way you win in this situation, is by not playing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Eventually, once you educate yourself for real,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you can comeback to school for your diploma and carry on with whatever your career may be.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A career will require a trail of diplomas,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the only other alternative here is becoming a founder, and creating a series of small companies.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Returning to school with the knowledge of a thousand books and years of experience,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">feels wonderful, it feels like revisiting your home town.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The curricula will still fore you into memorization,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but your self education will greatly help you with that.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Obviously, once you know the subjects for real,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the tests are trivial, if not a downright insult.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">At no point should you ever throw your years away,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if that is what High School or College Feels like, come back later.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real education is too important,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it has great impact on your decisions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">While pretending to get an education works on the surface,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">not having read a few hundred biographies may make your elder self regret your decisions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">SO there is no question here, if your school is fake,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">come back later, after you have learned on your own.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even the fact that all the tests you take from high school to college,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are connected together and rely on one another is not a good reason to participate in inauthentic education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your years are precious,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">not a single one is allowed to be thrown away.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you do return to school later on, keep in mind that professionals can't rely on people with inauthentic education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">self taught people with real knowledge, that accepted their responsibility for their own education will be in high demand.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But do not forget that the institution that you are re-entering,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is fundamentally inauthentic and relies on temporary memorization to stay in operation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This inauthenticity will begin manifesting it self in many ways,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and your stay there may become frustrating.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Also keep in mind, that your career may expect the kind of a person that feels OK with temporary memorization,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that being self educated, and equipped with diplomas is not a guaranteed that your career will be healthy for you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you are searching for guarantees in life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then make self education and becoming a business founder one and the same.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When I question the way education works,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I always think of Doctors, and how impossible it is for a self taught person to get there.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But even so, that is not an excuse not to be educated for real,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that is no excuse to forgo books that teach us about life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You still need the real deal,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">real knowledge, real wisdom, strong decisions that will make your elder self live life with great satisfaction, knowing that you have chosen wisely.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If your career choice interferes with you moving towards becoming a Wise and Great Being,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then the path you have chosen for yourself is blocked, or damaged, and you may need to rethink your career choice.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real knowledge, real wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">must always come first.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Whatever you want from your future,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you must first take care of yourself.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Be compassionate with yourself,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">love yourself.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you don't take great care of yourself,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then people will be too scared to care about you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Because when you hurt,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">those who care about you hurt too.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is a lot of incomplete things in our word,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there is a lot of broken promises, like standardized education, and healthy careers with proper retirement.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The only way to build new things and repair what is broken so that it may stand complete for the future generations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is to be authentic about what works today, and what does not.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Whatever the things today,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that are not yet strong enough, for you to climb on, so that you may reach your dreams, those are the things that need your help.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That is likely to be your Call To Greatness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the aim to your self education, and all the great many adventures, to follow.</div>
