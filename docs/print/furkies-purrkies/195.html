  <p>We must repair schools,</p>
  <p>and finally put an end to ideas like listen and repeat and short term memorization.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>The first and foremost is the elimination of grades,</p>
  <p>which also means elimination of standardized testing.</p>

  <p>Eventually, people who arrive at Gene Editing,</p>
  <p>will choose their own path through Biology.</p>

  <p>Mathematics can be studied from an enormous number of starting points,</p>
  <p>from Color Theories, and Music and Sound Processing,</p>
  <p>to 3D Printing, Game and Game Engine Design, Astrobiology, Cryptanalysis and Combinatorial Genomics,</p>
  <p>it is not presented as an aim, but rather a small stepping stone in a familiar context, and thus much more easily mastered.</p>

  <p>Once a student displays a long term curiosity for a subject,</p>
  <p>they will choose to be tested and choose to follow industry standards,</p>
  <p>they will also choose an evolving test program to which they themselves may contribute.</p>

  <p>The student moves at their own pace,</p>
  <p>leaving an open trail that can be reviewed by prospective employers,</p>
  <p>teachers, fellow researchers, and employers willing to pay for their study.</p>
