  <p>If you find your self in a desert,</p>
  <p>or yearning for one, or a hermitage, or just want to be left alone.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Then you are letting people get to you,</p>
  <p>you need to turn around and raise a shield.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is so easy, it is ridiculous, it is right in front of you,</p>
  <p>use audio books that fascinate you to become wise, and become a business entrepreneur to push poverty away.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A business entrepreneur is just someone that appreciates simplicity,</p>
  <p>and gets things to grow from within it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>They meet up with investors,</p>
  <p>and show them that they invented an investment multiplier.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The investor&apos;s 10,000 dollars becomes your $100,000,</p>
  <p>when it passes through your company.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Poverty is a huge bully,</p>
  <p>so let me explain a little bit more;</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Find a friend who can use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qfa9hGJzoY">lmms</a> to make workout music,</p>
  <p>and then get $10,000 from investors, or your moms, and very carefully use it for advertising.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>So now as people search for &quot;workout music&quot;,</p>
  <p>you will come up in ads, or on video sharing platforms, social networks, and so on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Now show them that your dance songs come in a range of beats per minute,</p>
  <p>but that requires a sign-up.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Give everyone lots of free stuff so that they can actually get healthy,</p>
  <p>but do charge for all the extras that end up costing you money so that everyone can see that you are being fair, including being fair to your investors.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Sell merch, and swag, get a couple of dancers,</p>
  <p>and a video editor to create <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dSgBsCVpqo">iPod Commercial</a> like dance videos.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Show your investors what you have,</p>
  <p>help them learn cutting shapes and shuffle dance.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Let them become your friends,</p>
  <p>let them get excited about a new fitness program:</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>&quot;Do the water dance, to get jiggly with it, and let us get you shredded, with finely shredded lettuce,</p>
  <p>- as we scientifically lower the caloric density of your daily food intake.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And as soon as this business fails, or starts failing,</p>
  <p>get serious about publishing a series of articles,.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Write about what not to do, and how to learn from failure,</p>
  <p>and what to do next - and then take your own advice.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Keep failing, always aim to fail,</p>
  <p>until one day you will notice, with all the stuff going on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>One of your companies is just freakishly and upside down backwards</p>
  <p>refusing to die, and keeps freaking growing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Give your investors a fair share,</p>
  <p>lots of merch for their grand kids.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And from now on use the money that your company makes,</p>
  <p>to expand the company further.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Failure happens for random reasons,</p>
  <p>probably mostly because your little company exists before technology is there.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Or before people are ready for it,</p>
  <p>or after they moved on, and now think differently than you do.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>So you just have to keep trying, keep failing,</p>
  <p>the investors know that odds are something like 1 in 10.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>So they will keep helping you,</p>
  <p>so as long as you keep learning and improving every time you launch a new company.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is not so much that their money is lost,</p>
  <p>investors are good at risk management.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is that your company must take a certain amount of money in,</p>
  <p>and then multiply it, to make you happy, make them happy, and make the customer happy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>There are some so called &quot;advanced&quot; tactics,</p>
  <p>like give away free bandwidth, until you are the world&apos;s leading platform.;</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And then inject ads that are really hard to remove from videos,</p>
  <p>until you crush and strangle the company for maximum profit... but forget that, we are creators, not destroyers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Most of the advanced tactics,</p>
  <p>are just worthless and heartless ideas in candy wrappers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>They teach little,</p>
  <p>and the big profits mean little, plus the people will know to avoid you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Advanced tactics are anti-patterns,</p>
  <p>so don&apos;t let anybody put you down because you believe in wholesome fitness, really simple search engines, or crazy little apps that make amazing music by just hitting the randomize settings button.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The more &quot;advanced&quot; their &quot;ideas&quot; the more dishonest they are,</p>
  <p>you be good; do no evil - out of an intransigent mind, and you won&apos;t regret it come your golden age.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

<div class="section">
  <p>Finding a source of wisdom,</p>
  <p>a solid source of information about the bounding conditions of life on earth and the human condition.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Will knock you out of bed,</p>
  <p>and plop a tent and backpack on top of your head.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>So that you may take a good look at the world,</p>
  <p>and who you are.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And then messing around with business,</p>
  <p>maybe even before high-school,</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Will make poverty less scary,</p>
  <p>poverty is not your fault.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Poverty is a symptom of immature governments,</p>
  <p>governments driven by underrepresented communities, and confused policy makers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Get together with friends,</p>
  <p>maybe fly a drone to take wedding photos.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Or just take photos of the city you live in,</p>
  <p>to create a beautiful brochure where you can charge money for ad space, or just sell stock videos and photos.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Or create a racing circuit for the drones,</p>
  <p>complete with mind blowing miniatures and drone blowing obstacles, that you capture in slow motion to make the drone owners heart sink even deeper as you hand them a box of smoldering plastic parts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Practice, and passion, and interesting ideas,</p>
  <p>will combine to help you create what the other high-schoolers who don&apos;t want to rise up against memorization, won&apos;t understand (and quite honestly, heartbreakingly so).</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It will be a shiny, fascinating, strangely heavy and kind of uncomfortable to hold,</p>
  <p>oddly... always wanting to spill on you, and terribly nerdy but somehow comfortably geeky:</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Design Portfolio,</p>
  <p>of amazingness.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The way people get their diplomas today,</p>
  <p>should be wrong.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The way it should be done, is you take a design portfolio,</p>
  <p>specifically and deliberately crafted and re-crafted to show who you really are, and share with schools, investors and companies that care about uniqueness, invention, and originality.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It should include photos of all your inventions and smiles dating all the way back to middle school,</p>
  <p>as you fiddle with a Raspberry PI zero and a DAC Hat to show off a variable song beat music player.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Send it out, and when you get accepted to Harvard, or Brown, and MIT,</p>
  <p>visit for a semester, but largely decline.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And carry on your work,</p>
  <p>and keep sending your portfolio around, until people figure out you are teaching them to follow.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And then just wait until the universities that aren&apos;t brain dead from mediocrity and status quo,</p>
  <p>deliver a diploma to you, for all the achievements and inspirations that you brought into the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Let your lifetime be a lifetime of achievement,</p>
  <p>let it be the new template for success.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Show the world that you understood early on,</p>
  <p>that when a company says &quot;Do no evil&quot; but then changes their mind...</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>They are simply announcing that they finished doing all your research,</p>
  <p>and have now opened the doors for you and your investors to replace them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And not with more brainless AI,</p>
  <p>but with a Mechanical Turk based Intelligence</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>One that will help people all around the world</p>
  <p>to have enough money on their card for a meal and roof over their head.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Let the other kids memorize, in the dog and pony shows that the confused teachers put up these days,</p>
  <p>you go, and show the world what an Authentic Intransigent Mind is capable of.</p>
