    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Each lesson must add to the next one,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we hardly need to push ourselves.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It sooo important that you start with something you like,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it can be anything flying kites, planting flowers, feeding squirrels.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There area always extras that come alongside,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and they change everything.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Flying kites, and photography will take you to droneography, possibly astrophotography,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">maybe model building, drone building, custom electronics, satellite engineering.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Planting flowers can steal you away to South America,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you could be setting up solar or mesh networks for Yawanawa.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think that the only happy thing that feeding squirrels leads to is more squirrels,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but perhaps you could become the first person to domesticate them, and sell them as a mini kittens.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Memorizing formulas is very much the opposite of education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is such an important lesson to be able to freely see relationships in formulas.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A simple formula can capture mountains of fascinating research,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">sometimes formulas leave out important extras that lead to even more curiosities.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One example that comes to mind is the <span>Ohm's Law<sup>[1]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you can use the little thing to calculate what resistor you need to light up a little LED light.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Basically, if you have a 9 volt battery, and a little LED light or diode,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you can't connect the two together because the 9V battery will burn out your 2.3V lamp.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So you use the Ohms Law to figure out how much resistance you need to put between the battery and the LED,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then you find a matching resistor in your goodie bag, and voila, you now have a night light.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Same applies to stepper motors, which are useful in creating custom 3D printers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you put a resistor on the line as not to damage expensive components.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You see what the problem is, of course,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in schools, they don't teach by means of practical applications.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They teach by abstract means, and for questionable purposes,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">which makes for a curriculum so baffling that we might as well skip it by memorizing it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If teachers gave you a 9V battery, and an LED light, and a box of resistors,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and begun teaching mathematics with Love, Passion, Admiration, Fascination, we could trust organized education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But they don't do that,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we have to do that.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And the curriculum we should follow is already within us,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is all those little things we are interested in.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And like teachers, parents may not be able to understand us,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they won't know how important is to go from LEGO to LEGO Techinc, and then our first breadboard.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">See it is all up to us, we have to keep hooping amongst our curiosities to make our way towards wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so that we can become creators, inventors, dreamers, and thinkers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And then come our retirement, we'll be surely granted an opportunity to become the teachers we wished we had,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and write and teach, and with love, and passion, and admiration, and fascination that we once needed.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is the only way the world can grow,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and there is much growing up ahead of us.</div>
