    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">On the last day of the old year,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">kids were granted the power to come up with a name for our newly united world...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It all stared a long time ago, it was about not repeating history's mistakes,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a newly found emphasis on not committing the sins of our grand-grand-grand-fathers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Young people begun rejecting Jury Duty by recognizing Poverty as a mind eating virus,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when the Judge asked if anybody couldn't serve, people would rise and say "Virus of Poverty".</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It meant that they were unable to take the oath, that they could not be an impartial Juror,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because they were convinced that Universal Basic Income would prevent The Defendant from committing the crime in the first place.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The Judges had their hands tied, but they loved to hear it, and it always restored their faith in the world:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I stand against, The Disproportionate Mass Incarceration of People Made Ill by The Virus Of Poverty"</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Back in 2021 schools had to go online, and that exposed their weakness for all to see,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">people, and notably their future employers, lost interest in what organized education became.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There was a shift toward self-organizing education where kids kept portfolios,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">of their own paths through knowledge, and at their own natural pace.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But it wast until the first paying school, that things became clear for the youngest generation,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the school replaced imaginary grades, with real money that the children would learn to reason about and use.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">By rejecting the status quo, and not settling on the irrelevant minimums,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Humanity increased her pace of progress, collective intelligence, and foresight.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It took less than twenty years, to get climate under control,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it was the children of the people that grew up by questioning authority and status quo.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Weapons manufacturing, profit optimization, economic fairy tales, greed, apathy, and hate - all fell,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as the world united under the new name: <span>Worldie McWorldface<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
