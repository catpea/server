    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">To Share Wisdom</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You may not realize that the way you have been treated in school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">has been slowly turning you away from knowledge and wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">See, the teachers convinced us all that what they are doing is sharing knowledge,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but it is actually the opposite of knowledge that they are sharing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real knowledge comes with real results,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">fake knowledge depends on making you feel perpetually inadequate and then squeezes you into desperation just to make you thing you made progress as it pushes you along.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real knowledge brings Happiness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it makes you ridiculous with your inventions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">With every cheerfully useless invention,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you learn something priceless, and create an unspeakably beautiful addition to your Portfolio.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As to the fantasy of good grades and good jobs.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You shouldn't be surprised that the people who cram and memorize, do get the best jobs but only by cheating and lying, and manipulating, and by being well connected,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">thus, destroying the environments, and the very goodness of that position by creating that toxic environment.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We can all imagine that one perfect job, where creativity is cherished above all,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and they would never hire a liar, because liars are toxic.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And we all need to stop with the fantasies,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">those jobs only exist when the company is forming, once they get that $100M venture capitol, only those who perform at maximum will be kept, and only until they burn out.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No, no, no.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is not cool to live in the office drinking free energy drinks and writing your best code ever.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You need wisdom, balance, knowledge, dignity, Content of Character,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">being quirky in a high powered job where the suits don't even speak your language is not cool.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All these people that you think don't get it, have negotiated contracts with expensive lawyers, and guaranteed golden parachutes,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you are still the little guy, no matter how big your code.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As sweet as those memories are,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the job is not the point, our lives are meant to be lived in great dignity and wisdom, with great foresight and onward to creating a body of knowledge that will make lasting contributions to Human Kind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have to Think Big,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there is no other way.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If there are temporary exceptions, the exceptions want you to have a real education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they want you to fight for real knowledge, so that they may love you for helping them grow.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A 4.0 GPA has go nothing to do with those exceptions,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">memorization and cramming will prevent you from getting into one of those rare situations, even if you do come across it (most of us won't)</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For you High School or maybe Middle School, or even college poses a confusing challenge,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as you detect it is not possible to get an education because everything is too disconnected and you must memorize or you fail classes and destroy your GPA.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But for someone who is comfortable with lying,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">pretending to get an education, to get a dream job, is a dream come true.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They actually make that dumb fantasy happen,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but that life is stressful, unstable, and a house of cards.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Lying is like living life in a VR helmet,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they aren't actually there, making that progress, they are still in High School, lying, pretending, still a kid.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Forget the fantasy of getting a good job for getting good grades,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">build your own companies, become an entrepreneur, the sooner the better.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is too unstable,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">life it too precious, and there are way too many moody people in your way, not to mention the liars.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And no, graduating from MIT is still part of the same fantasy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you can't cram, it does not work, it doesn't do anything for your mind, you just end up with debt.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Brand-name colleges are not in the business of restoring authenticity to the world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they are in the business of staying in business and making people's education look rare and prestigious so that they can stick their foot in some door.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And a full ride scholarship, is never a full ride, they'll still make money of of you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or you will have to cram double and learn even less to graduate on time before it all expires.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The only way to win,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is not to play.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I know what you are thinking, the Dean, surely the Dean is honest,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the Dean will help you, they will see the goodness of your heart, that is what they are there for...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Surely.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I believe that too, and with tears in my eyes,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that there are people up there that can help all of us, that they moment they see our hearts, they will never betray us.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But we need to,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">snap out of it!</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Listen up, listen,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the only way - is to built your own way.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Find the right Audio Books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and begin building your own companies, until you learn how to do it right,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Forget the stupid fantasies,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">use them as a way to recognize signs of being misled.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is no diploma, there is no cake, the lady can't sing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is just lies and liars, because they always, albeit temporarily, out compete the good people.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The only way to win is not to play in a game where a liar always has unlimited advantage.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now listen carefully, eventually,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you will become thirty five years old.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It happens to all of us,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">few years before the middle age, we kind of slow down and take a look at ourselves.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is always an amazing experience,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you get to see that you are more of yourself... you get to witness yourself.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are almost able to keep extending that measuring stick,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to kind of get an idea of where the heck you are headed, and what regrets may be, and what your elder-self is constantly complains about.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once the 20s are over,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you enter your age of enlightenment, where you get to synthesize new things out of what you have learned.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We learn best from connecting with great stories of Discovery and Adventure,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and inhering the minds and independence of those heroes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Is it a big deal to learn for real,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">getting to 35 on empty is scary.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It happens to good people too, often very delicate people get mislead by all this complexity, but they catch up very quickly,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">being strong and cheerful in a world of lies, still represents a hell of an education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">At 40, it is time to begin polishing our wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and trying to find the best and most creative way to share.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">At 40, we get to a point, where it becomes really meaningful,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to share our knowledge, and create the works that help young people.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Liars end up in the beginning,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they need to start learning from scratch, that is that mad circle.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But those who have taken to learning for real, who have great experiences to distill into wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">begin preparing for the biggest task of their next 40 years, sharing their ever growing body of wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Not everyone will like your books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they will appreciate it, but also find it mostly wrong, that is OK.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is the people who get launched 20 years ahead</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by inheriting from your works that matter here.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They are your readers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and they will find you to be a friend in time, and a part of their extended family.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I can't stress this enough here, they need real knowledge, and an authentic struggle for real knowledge,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they won't be impressed with your cramming for tests to keep a good GPA.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Everything you do from middle school on,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">must be strong and authentic, because you will need it later in your life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You will rely on your Content of Character,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so it must be unshakable.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Remember, each choice you make,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">either adds or takes away from you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All the choices combined to together,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">dictate the complete life ahead of you (paraphrasing Renaissance Man) and your content of character (MLK Jr.)</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Authenticity,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will always add.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Inauthenticity,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will always replace some important part of you with blank space.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And compromise, compromise never adds anything to goodness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it can only take from goodness and empower some damn evil (paraphrasing Ayn Rand's John Galt speech).</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">May all your knowledge shine with the brightest of lights,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">may it all add to fuel unseen ideas.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Come your middle age,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">may an urge to write your books become unstoppable.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And may all your hard earned wisdom add to make your aches count for even more,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by helping countless others to start, where you left off.</div>
