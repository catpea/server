    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have a tendency to take things for granted,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and we hold many Cognitive Biases that can harm us.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is really important to question everything,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">all the Sciences were born this way.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The sciences are a product of the Scientific Principle,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a product of the search for truth by means of real evidence, clear thinking and healthy skepticism.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our world is changing very quickly,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but almost all the major mistakes Humanity has made, are currently being repeated.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The world has also become more interconnected,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">those born to one system of belief are now able to inspect other systems, onward to setting themselves free.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Beyond cults, many countries are attempting to warp reality, but that is also not possible anymore,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">all the fantasies that have been hammered into people are now becoming the cracks in the walls.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There cannot be an army large enough to fight or even withstand reality,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the harsh truth is that bringing fantasy into the real world is an act of self-destruction.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All the fantasies and walls will fade, today's problem with borders and cults,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is that they are a nuisance on our way to Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They delay our progress forward taking up precious decades,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to delay the repairs our world needs, can only translate to contributing to all the suffering.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are infinite in our minds,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">just as soon as we notice and identify a problem, we instantly know how to out-think it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Cults and Borders, are just one part of the problem,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">something has happened to Schools, and Universities they are not helping the world grow they way they should be.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It may just be that lectures need to be personalized, instead of standardized,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the reward should not be seen as a nice job, but a company that the student can build with the knowledge they gain.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This way the student will be likely to pick what is not only relevant but also meaningful and real for their business success,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this will push back on semesters of lectures that that have no real impact on their life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And it is foolish to think that their quest for a stable business will not take them across all the sciences,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the sciences call to everyone.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Personalized education doesn't really translate to never becoming aware of some subject,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as this kind of education relies on worlds most beloved books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Books as a whole provide a greater spectrum of subjects than that of lowest common denominator standardized education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and here while being exposed to new subjects, students learn the lessons they are ready to learn, and at a pace that is best for them, rather than being forces into useless memorization.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We don't learn the way schools teach,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we learn when we move from one curiosity to another, that motion is affected by what we already know, where we are and what we are doing on our life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">By making education work for real, we lessen the complexity of the solutions to problems ahead,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">problems like money in politics, and mass incarceration, and poverty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A more knowledgeable world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is a more capable world.</div>
