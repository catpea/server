      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The Day Humanity Entered The Age Of Wisdom</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We can't stand up to corruption,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if we are not knowledgeable enough to see where it is.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Working towards good grades rather than Empowering Wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">actually works to shield what is broken about the world today.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Only real and meaningful, functional and powerful-education can grant us the tools needed,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if we don't have the necessary tools for thinking then we can't see enough.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One of Humanity's greatest challenges is in overcoming,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this ridiculous notion of minimum lowest-common-denominator education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are each to stand in relentless pursuit of excellence,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">education is life long, volitional, deliberate and life saving.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The future of Earth depends on it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">many of us have felt the threat of Cold War and Mutually Assured Destruction,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we watched the Ozone Hole emerge out of greed and lack of wisdom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we are witnessing species disappearing every day,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">lack of understanding of climate change,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and basics of disease prevention.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is happening <em>not</em> because people are evil,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but because they never received a meaningful education, never read enough books to break out and become inspired.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Many people do notice this,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and do take to videos, audio books and lectures,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and they do become moved.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They learn, and grasp a deeper nature of the thinking mistakes they made,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">from simple topics like <span>Raw Milk<sup>[1]</sup></span> consumption, and the pseudo-scientific <span>Homeopathy<sup>[2]</sup></span> and <span>Chiropractic Treatments<sup>[3]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to dangers of <span>Vaccine Hesitancy<sup>[4]</sup></span> and other <span>Pseudoscienific Garbage<sup>[5]</sup></span> they are able to become more realistic about other things.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But this is difficult, it is not as common as it should be,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and what an awful injustice it is to deny these basic facts of living.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is the challenge we must overcome,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we tried organized education and with grades and incompetent teachers we witnessed generations of children being pushed into Poverty of Mind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Grades, what a tragic idea,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and how easily will children convince themselves that they are not enough; not good enough.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">How many teachers tried to tell their students that they are bad at learning,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and how many children became convinced of that, that they are not smart?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Where truth is, that we are all equally capable,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">all capable of genius so as long as it is real kind and not the "I am better than you kind" like photographic memory</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(which is fake, no one ever had it; people just said they did to look smart).</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">World's politicians are facing these flaws as well,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they can't tell if Homeopathy is real or not, not without a real education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Today, there is nothing that can be done about people in authority lacking in education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the only thing that can stop them is time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And it is our job now,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that the new generation of Policy Makes does not suffer from inability to tell real from fantasy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In the absence of teachers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we become the teachers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I challenge you my Dear Readers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to books, to becoming a teacher, and a Great Being,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">helping the world grow in health.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have to help children understand that a life of fantasy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is not a complete life, that it is our right to live in realty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our generation, must be the generation of the Well Read, of The Wise, of The Teachers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with a clear vision of the future; we are not to fight, we are to learn and teach.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The children will grow up into a world where corruption of today,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">has passed of old age, of its own toxic sickness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The children must learn to be teachers as well,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">bu they face even a greater task, the task of becoming Incorruptible Leaders.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The leaders the world hopes to see today,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">those are the children that look up to us for guidance.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We must rise today.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rise against lies and liars, manipulators and cheaters, leeches and big fat white lice,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we must rise against poverty, against fake education and the grades that connive children they are not enough.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We must rise, against every ongoing mistake,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">every invisible wall,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and stand our ground.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Knowing that our world is the world of reality,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and that is the only world worthy of us.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">With all our might, we are not to fight,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we are to live our lives and finally reach happiness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but on our way there we are to learn, become wise, become teachers, and aim to become great beings.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Not only for our own dignity and to honor those we love,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but also for all the future yet to come.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">May all the future generation read our works,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and determine that this year, was the first year of the new era they they hold so dearly.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That this year, was the year that future thinkers marked,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as The Day Humanity Entered Into The Age Of Wisdom.</div>
