  <p>so lift your brush to the canvas, Dear Friends.</p>

  <p>Fatigue, overwork, imbalance, tiredness,</p>
  <p>all conspire to keep us running in circles.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Especially, right before setting off on an adventure,</p>
  <p>sometimes it takes up to a week, to remember who we are.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>First couple of days, are the worst,</p>
  <p>it feels like adventure is not worth it, and we need to go back.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

<div class="section">
  <p>Back to what?</p>
  <p>And how many years has it been now?</p>

  <p>Adventure is a cute upside-down word,</p>
  <p>hoping to remind you that you are full of energy and sunshine.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>That you are a professional troublemaker,</p>
  <p>and a fancy bookworm.</p>

  <p>As good as your poker face is, under stress,</p>
  <p>Ohh, the sh*tstorm that you will sow and reap, with your beautiful and perfect deadpan comedy,</p>
  <p>upon an unsuspecting fellow shopper, whilst waiting in the checkout line at the local Supermarket.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>They won&apos;t *ever* know what hit them, and you will uncontrollably giggle all the way back to your car,</p>
  <p>whilst crunching the ice cream with sprinkles you just bought, with a whole new level of joy.</p>

  <p>Nevermind, that for the first time in your life you own a phat marker,</p>
  <p>and you started tagging the toilets with your incredible and edgy wit.</p>

  <p>You&apos;ll get it under control,</p>
  <p>I know you will.</p>

  <p>There is just a couple of little problems that we do need to talk about...</p>
  <p>(and this does not apply to all, just a couple of my readers)</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Firstly, stop answering kind greetings &quot;Oh, hey, how are you?&quot; with,</p>
  <p>&quot;Still Here&quot; - honestly, we know, we&apos;ve noticed, we just want to known how you are doing this?</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And then telling people that you are, or used to be, or whatever: a Firefighter - must stop,</p>
  <p>honestly, most people already assumed - that you used you volunteer - to put out hot fires.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Your multiple fanny packs, that&apos;s on point, everybody knows that all the great superheroes,</p>
  <p>from Dwayne The Rock Goddamn Johnson to Tomb Raider and Freaky Batman, root and toot for you.</p>

  <p>Now, this poem would be incomplete if I didn&apos;t ask you to get up right now,</p>
  <p>and stretch a leg or two, a bit, and lookup <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/prdz2WJpRnd9mvU5A">Nurnberg Trailhead at W Nurnberg Rd, Free Soil, MI 49411</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Or any other tiny Wilderness that&apos;s not too near, not too far,</p>
  <p>and spend the afternoon picking out a backpack, a fancy little tent...</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The fluffiest sleeping bag you can find,</p>
  <p>and one of those fancy inflatable pillows that will make you pass right out.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Grab a box of matches, the biggest, baddest Overkill Rambo knife you can find,</p>
  <p>a water bottle, peanut butter wonder bread, a confusing compass and a load of sausages.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And go, don&apos;t delay, if the northern hemisphere is cold,</p>
  <p>head on south, if south is cranky, head on north.</p>

  <p>You are not supposed live to work,</p>
  <p>you are only supposed to work just enough, to live so that you can Read and Listen to Books, and Grow.</p>

  <p>Every day is the first day of the rest of your life,</p>
  <p>and young or old, every day is a beautiful gift.</p>

  <p>And there is no such thing as old age,</p>
  <p>that&apos;s just a boogie man that the cowards made up</p>
  <p>(If they can&apos;t become a great adventurer, why should anybody else)</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Old age is a privilege, denied to many.</p>

  <p>People that care about you want you to be Healthy, and Mighty,</p>
  <p>they want you to be an Inspiration, that will forever inspire them to, Greatness.</p>

  <p>Do not let a day go by...</p>

  <p>And gol dang it, you&apos;re a Warrior.</p>
  <p>Get two Rambo knives, the one on the left for sausages.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The one on the right, for throwing...</p>
  <p>and for chopping Wood, and Moose, and Beaver</p>
  <p>- that are so foolish as to wonder into <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/CR1N3rkverBXrVd19">your beautiful campsite</a>.</p>

  <p>Eat them,</p>
  <p>or Curse Them!</p>

  <p>But whatever you do,</p>
  <p>get moving right now.</p>

  <p>Due north, due south,</p>
  <p>whichever is more welcoming.</p>
