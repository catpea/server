  <div class="paragraph">I know what your initial worries are,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but they are all false worries.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Listen to me carefully,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I have something serious to say, for a change.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">People with photographic memory do not exist,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">everyone who has claimed to have photographic memory, lied.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This type of "I am superior",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is the same damn thing that fuels racism and hate.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When you buy into this "I am holier than thou" s**t,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">something important is taken away from you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And not just important to you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">important to Humanity, to History.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Being born a genius is fake too,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is bad etiquette to use that word once you do master something.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The word Genius, or Savant,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is a bad word, because it has been used to rob Humanity of Beauty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When teachers grade you down, for something you forgot,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because you never used it, or <span>they tried to teach you in an abstract setting<sup>[1]</sup></span> and it made no sense.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Or they forced you to memorize it so you could perform on a test like an actor,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or just told you that the world is not fair.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They committed the same crime against you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and against Humanity, and History.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Their motive, is not sick superiority,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but just getting paid, for a job they often hate, so that thy can another miserable day as a fraud.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The number of Great Dreamers that were prevented from growing because of teachers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is so high, that one can only weep.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are taught to respect and listen to teachers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but it is them, who have sold the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">(If any teachers are listening to this, it is time to stop making your kids memorize, either help them grow for real, or get out of their way,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">remember those old metaphors, what goes around comes around, you reap what you sow, and whatever you send out there, you get back times three.)</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once you play the French Horn, a second wave or morons will stroll your way,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they will tell you that you will never be as good as Tchaikovsky.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once your music hits the European Dance Floors,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">another wave of fools will come...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And they will tell you that you will never win the Tchaikovsky Competition,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">where artists are still taught to use their fingers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And they will keep coming,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the only way to stop the critics from trying to stop you, is to stop listening.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Stop listening to people that are not just saying you can't,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but attempt to convince you with fake education, fake meaningless grades, and endless insults.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Never forget that you can make your own competition,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">one attached to a school you build, perhaps a virtual school for all.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Perhaps not just a school where you teach how to use Digital Audio Workstations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but how to use Programming Languages the way <span>Sam Aaron<sup>[2]</sup></span> uses them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And certainly a school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">where you put an end to killing souls of artists.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The French Horn is more than Tchaikovsky could grasp,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in the primitive era that he was alive in.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That's right, this is a new era,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">an era where professional artists worry about falling behind to teenagers with computers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I know what you are thinking,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I know nothing about notes, I can't compose.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Maybe you are thinking,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I don't know music theory.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Or perhaps,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I don't know what a French Horn even, freaking is.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is this what your ear worries about?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Music, is not about knowing where to put your fingers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is about creating a road forward, one of Beauty and adventure.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I want you to hear, what it is like to compose music from your soul,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">from your heart, unafraid, in a world where if you fail, you will come back the next day.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And the next day, you will feel nothing but certainty,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and a kinship with all the others, including Tchaikovsky, no matter how old fashioned his use of The Horn is.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And if you fail again, and my goodness I hope you do, then, then, your mind will begin taking notes apart, it will rip through brass,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">out of an animal like yearning for comprehension of composition.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It will come as automatically as running, as learning to ride a bicycle,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in just a few more failures, just a few more failures, you will earn it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You will hear it, whatever your instrument of choice,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you will hear it in popular music, because there are countless other lovers out there.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Some of them, still learning, some still tricked by teachers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">others, your upcoming competition, racing forward as fast as yo are.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is our world now... the world of the electron and the mouse,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the beauty of the infinite potential of the digital creations.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The Pursuit of Excellence does not distinguish,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the original instrument, or the synthesized one.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now, listen to how I find a note I like.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">* PROGRESSION OF NOTE SEEKING PLAYS *</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do you know what this process of note seeking, is called?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It is called composition, and do not let anybody tell you otherwise.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">THE PROCESS OF FINDING THE RIGHT NOTES,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">IS HOW YOU MAKE MUSIC.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">YOU DO NOT MAKE MUSIC,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">BY LISTENING TO TEACHERS TELLING YOU HOW MUSIC IS MADE.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do you hear me,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">do you hear me...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And this is not a secret, it is just how bad schools have become,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">how easily we have listened to the teachers, how strong the imperceptible grasp of whatever it is that we perceive as authority.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If there is a secret to be had here,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is that school is the last place you go to learn.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And that is is the first place.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">where gentle and creative minds come to an end.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now, here is the whole song, and oh my gosh, please forgive the drums at the end, I couldn't help it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this is my first day learning the horn, and it is even MORE POWERFUL than I thought.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And believe me, you can do anything,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">those who stand in your way are just bad dreams.</div>
