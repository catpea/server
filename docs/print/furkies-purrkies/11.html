</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">IF you can keep your head when all about you</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But make allowance for their doubting too;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or being hated, don't give way to hating,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And treat those two impostors just the same;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you can make one heap of all your winnings</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And lose, and start again at your beginnings</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And never breathe a word about your loss;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To serve your turn long after they are gone,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And so hold on when there is nothing in you</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">' Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If all men count with you, but none too much;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you can fill the unforgiving minute</div>
  <div class="paragraph">With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And - which is more - you'll be a Man, my son!</div>
