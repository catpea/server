      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Evenings At Nordhouse: Adventures At The Edge Of The Universe</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are each a unique creature,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so what I felt won't be what you will feel when you are there.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But there are some things</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that may be similar.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are more than 218 moons in our solar system,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">each one is an edge, just like the beach at Nordhouse is an edge.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is really,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">just about the same place, gravity doesn't matter much since you are elated anyway.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are royalty,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">out on your very own Moon.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is important that you have paper an pen,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">make sure your notes resist getting wet, test it, things can get wet out there.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The journal, is for a single compound sentence type things,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is good to write it down.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Though you can't possibly forget it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but if you did, the thought would come back to you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The journal is so that you can scribble a big thought,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and move on to the bigger one.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Some example observations maybe...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"Schools are not teaching, tests aren't testing knowledge,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">diplomas are bunk, colleges are a business, and the whole thing is a scam."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"Uneducated voters are easily swayed by all the things that uneducated,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">have always showed to be passionate about, racism, nationalism, hate, and us vs. them logic."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"Military targets young boys, because it is easy, because they are easily impressed,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they don't know enough about the world nor will they know war until it is too late;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">fathers are sending their children to kill each other in wars about thing that they ruined."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"The Thirteenth Amendment of United States, may force those who participate in Jury Duty,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">into participating in slavery, as a slaver."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"Criminal who are fractured by the bony hands of poverty,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are not themselves, they are they are victimized by poverty and the denial of even the most basic human rights."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"The unforgivable by the desperate act of bankruptcy, College Debt,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">alters the meaning of money, a meaning already eroded by the worst of human ideas,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">unforgivable debt makes what is owed void, and invalid, it is just a sick version of money that isn't real."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"Government paying colleges for student debt, to save the students from it, is a temporary fix;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">asking why colleges charge so much money, is not even the right question,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Do colleges teach?", is the correct question."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"Poverty and Lack of Education, has brought progress down to a stop,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">countries that fought for freedom with great vision,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are falling back down for lack of it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that vision can only be found in real education, in real wisdom that opens gateways to greatness."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">These observations never end... some of them are a little crooked,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you may not have a full picture.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But once you make the observation,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you will become sensitive to all the subjects that stand in support of it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You won't make wrong observations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">just ones that need more information.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If there is something that is really calling to you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">like Philosophy called to me.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Then just get 15 audio books about it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">sometimes books that don't come out well as audio books, are just not that good.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Audio books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">may just mark the elite of books worth investing time it,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Einstein said,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So if a book doesn't explain something valuable and magnificent, simply,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it probably relates to another quote which goes:</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"There's a sucker born every minute"</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So just keep an eye out for the fake charts,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">designed to sell garbage meant to pray on uneducated readers,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Or charts that that see nothing wrong when the <span>pseudo-authors buy their own books with campaign money<sup>[1]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and then use the profits from book sales to launder the money further.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The beautiful thing about real books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is that they help you figure out who the world's true leaders are.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They often greatly admire each other,</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>so once you find one<sup>[2]</sup></span>, <span>there will be a bunch more<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You can see what happens,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">out on the edge.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You pull yourself out by your own bootstraps,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">from all the noise and chaos that you accepted because you were too young to question it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I still remember the teacher saying "You need to learn math because you won't always have a calculator on hand",</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>but what I was saying was: you need a computer to learn math for real<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Because I could see <span>there was real fun to be had with mathematics it truly is a beautiful invention<sup>[5]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but <span>teaching formulas without explanation is destroys that beauty, math teachers in their madness are destroying the beauty of mathematics<sup>[6]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One of the anchors that helps me remember problems in middle school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is being accused of cheating on homework, the teacher gave me a bad grade for an impressive (if I may) program I wrote my self.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This made my bullies laugh at me, of course,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they saw me pacing up and down the enormous corridors writing that program on a piece of paper for days.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In some cases,</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>school can easily destroy us<sup>[7]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The damage caused by fantasy education of nonsense-lecture-and-brainless-test is unspeakable,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">pretty much everything broken right now, is because the schools are broken.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I write this in 2021 as the vaccines are just about to become accessible,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the vaccine hesitancy problem that is about to be reveled is a perfect example of the damage fake education has caused.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just to make it more personal, after the masks are no longer going to be required, you will see husbands bringing the virus home,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and making their family sick, because their level of education trickles them into thinking the "vaccines has problems", or to quote another case "vaccines have chemicals".</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The gravity of the damage, can bring down entire nations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">without anybody noticing what has gone wrong and where; they will still talk about paying off college debt and giving more money to the teachers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Nobody in politics will notice, or believe, that schools have caused this,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because it is too complicated for their context, outside of their field of whatever.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">More than the middle school, or calculator nonsense, our parents are doing something similar where it comes to College and Career,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the correct path is Real Education and Entrepreneurship.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">College and Career are so popular, and there is so much money in this,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that there was never a chance that this could withstand corruption.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Getting fired should not be a threat,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">getting replaced by younger, or just more cunning employees should not be a threat in your life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You need a better plan than College and Career,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and a life where you can live in balance, and with a solid grasp on reality.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">By this time,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you'll have a fire going, you don't always have to go to the beach to watch the sunset.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You maybe, sharpening a stick,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a sausage can be a pretty tasty treat after a day of going up and down dunes in search of some mysterious lost lake, or leg of trail, or just following a goose.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">See, your thoughts no longer flow from the middle out,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they now come from the edge, they get under the things.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">you don't just look at what is before you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but that the many hings that connect to it, that may dictate the future ahead of you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It if feels like you are a Castaway,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is only because Humans are not meant to be alone, we are tribal creatures.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your Audio Books, will connect you with the others,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and you will know deep down that they are important enough to override that curse of the cast away, your soul needs Philosophy and Wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Since it is a small wilderness, or later on a popular trail like the AT,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you won't feel like a Castaway for long, your Audio Books will be connecting you to all the world's true leaders, it won't feel lonely.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But, if you have friends,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">bring them along.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It rained pretty bad once, and then a thunderstorm came,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this is exactly what you should expect to find, out on the edge.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are now part of the universe,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">might as well be camping on a distant moon.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Make sure that flash floods won't wash away any of your gear,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and find a spot where it is safe when a great storm comes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Check for trees that are about to fall, and keep away from those,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if you can't find a good spot, then know of a safe spot where you can move on a rainy day.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A great storm, is terrifying,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but it is also a great honor.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Every other Adventurer and Creature of Renaissance before you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">had to endure storms just as big, plan ahead, enjoy the fragrance of the woods.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I curled up in my sleeping bag,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">put on my headphones and started playing <span>We Are All Connected<sup>[8]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I didn't wait for the storm to pass,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the headphones were enough to dull the thunder.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I fell asleep to the storm,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it wasn't that uncomfortable.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In the morning everything seemed greener,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think there were deer by the lake.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It was chilly, but just as soon as the sun comes out from behind the ancient dune, things will warm up,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and you can take a walk to a sunny spot.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One time I saw a storm on the horizon,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it looked beautiful, but I got scared, it didn't even occur to me that it was probably too far, there were no clouds overhead.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My plan was to back up and run for the <span>trail end<sup>[9]</sup></span>, which I did and I just slept there in my little tent,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">even though the storm did not come.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I was sure it would, because I think, I am pretty sure, maybe, the grass had a very faint bluish outline,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">which seemed to me like static electricity and a sign of trouble.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It looked very beautiful,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it looked very magical.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But with a storm flashing out on the horizon,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I wasn't taking any chances, <span>I was right by the lake<sup>[10]</sup></span>, on top of a little dune with a larger camping spot right behind it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If I was lightening,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that was the spot I would hit first, so. I. moved.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In the morning I had the pleasure of looking for a new spot,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and I found one, that reminded me of a top of a volcano.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I spent many days there daydreaming, and listening to books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I had a paper copy of Robinson Cruse and I lazily read that too.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I didn't really pack up and drive away,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I went to the other parking site on Forest Trail, I slept at the State Park again.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I only packed up to leave,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when leaving was all that was left.</div>
</div>
