  <p>Captains Log, Supplemental, September 13, 2820</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>There is a huge unmentionable Universal Debt,</p>
  <p>that originally, by mistake, landed on a single credit card,</p>
  <p>of an unsuspecting young lady in Belgium</p>
  <p>- nobody knows why, including myself!</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>She was just born the year it happened,</p>
  <p>so she didn&apos;t even need a card.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Someone just noticed that all debt was being charged to her account,</p>
  <p>never said anything, and somehow, it stayed that way, for many hundreds of years afterwards.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Once she became legally obliged to do something about her debt circa 2040,</p>
  <p>it was just cheaper to ignore the account, than to print the bill,</p>
  <p>not to mention the bills needed to pay it off.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Notably some decades later,</p>
  <p>arguably the most valuable human being on Earth,</p>
  <p>would sweetly joke that she was the Most Worthless One.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>She&apos;s been paying for everyone&apos;s food,</p>
  <p>including all the pizzas economists eat,</p>
  <p>so no one dared to say a thing for ages.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Hundreds of years later,</p>
  <p>the new generations just assumed,</p>
  <p>money was invented to be helpful (certainly not hurtful),</p>
  <p>and that Little Chlo&#xE9; was the original inventor.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We are one family, after all,</p>
  <p>there is no need to go hungry - never was.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is of some note, that the most expensive thing she paid for,</p>
  <p>was the first Star Ship, the Asteroid class Ark that begun colonizing the Milky Way.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>That age was marked by our crossing from Homo Sapiens, to Homo Deus,</p>
  <p>and the Star Ship was named, after none other than our little Chlo&#xE9;.</p>
