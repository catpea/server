    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The Queen&#39;s Tongue: Learning English</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My uncle left for Africa and later America,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and left behind was this interestingly scratchy and neatly smelling postcard.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It turned out that the city pictured there,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">was New York.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Being a fan of the new things,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I begun getting used to the idea that I would have to live there for a couple of years.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I had some problems,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that I first needed to solve.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The biggest problem was,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">actually pretty big.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Because, I was very smol,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I might have been seven, maybe nine, but at nine it wouldn't seem like such a big problem.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In a word,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I needed to become an adult.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That New Yorkers spoke a different language,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">would have registered if I though about it, but I had my hands full with growing up.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It wasn't long before my parents bought me my Commodore 64,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">since everyone was saying "Computers Are The Future" I figured I should learn how to use it too.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Right about the same time, we begun receiving the British Sky Broadcasting Network signal,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the linguistic barrier hit pretty hard.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We also had Pro 7 and RTL, which was in German,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but it was showing Rosanne, which was about America.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">On one end I was learning about America in German,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and learning English from The DJ Kat show on the British TV.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I once knew as much German as English,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and I actually used German in real life once.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">On my way back from a trip to Netherlands,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as we stopped on a rest area in Germany a Harley Davidson rider came up to us and asked:</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"Was ist die uhre?",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I made my colleague show him his watch.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The rider might not have realized,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that we didn't speak German.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It wasn't long before I ended up in New York,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in Brooklyn, the city with streets paved with gold (or Mica as I was told)</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I had to fill out some medical paperwork,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">across the city, so it was as good of a time as any to ride the freaking subway for the first freaking time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I did not get lost,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but let me just reveal to you what it was like.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All the station names I memorized, over an over, so that I wouldn't get lost, or miss my stop,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they were all wrong, they didn't sound anything like what I memorized.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Only a small part of this was the speaker,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I memorized them in the language I knew, not the everyone that New Yorkers spoke.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And the same thing happened, a person walked up top me and asked "Do yo have the time?",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">well I did, but in the heat of the moment, I only knew the numbers separately, and I wasn't sure if I should say 1-5, or 3.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And it was just too much,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so in my best British Tongue, I uttered: "I don't speak English".</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They asked something else,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but I already failed that test.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now, I was learning English, I was doing very well,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and if I had 45 seconds, to pull my self together I would have remembered Fifteen, and to say 3PM, instead, and maybe even throw in you're welcome, to show off.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was 42 seconds short.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is a good thing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because all lessons aside, this is how you begin learning a language for real.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I never practiced numbers, or days of the week,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I just willed myself to know them, from all the TV I watched, and Closed Captions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once I had my medical paperwork,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and went to school.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The English teacher ACCUSED ME, of knowing English,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">of pretending no to speak it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And she failed me multiple times,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there was this hokey ceremony where everyone was getting awards for achievement, and I didn't get one.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The person I was sitting next to was laughing - that he got one,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but the English teacher removed me from that list, because she was convinced I didn't achieve anything, that I was pretending not to speak English.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I was so proud of myself,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and I wasn't scared of her at all.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">She made a acquaintance of mine, Ewa cry,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and I went to the principal, who I am sure gave her a stern talk.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">English turned out to be a lot larger than I expected,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but being exposed to these situations especially stressful or insulting, makes us hungry for language.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Not so long after that,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was working in Wyandotte on web design, which is is very easy to learn, and I highly recommend it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And a client complained that they couldn't understand me,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the office started discussing how my accent was heavy, I was now able to speak but accent was heavy, something I couldn't quite hear myself.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Though you can still hear traces of it in the way I pronounce the word Basic,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I can't feel anything wrong with the way I pronounce it, until; I hear it on audio.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">BASIC is the name of a programming language, and one of the first words that I learned in English,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and I was still pronounce it the Polish way.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But get this, later, it turned out,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">my accent was fine, it was my babbling about connecting to FTP servers, and talking about HTML tags, HTML tables that caused the trouble.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It was still somewhat stressful to speak to strangers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but now the stress was revealing it self in not being tactful about their vocabulary.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think it is safe to say,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that it was a huge milestone in my self education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Reading wasn't much of a problem,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think we underestimate the magic of closed captioned TV, I think that is what taught to me to read.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I plowed through a shelf of cheap paperbacks,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and I had zero problems with comprehension, I was reading books about UFOs and really enjoyed it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">By the time books on tape, or narrated books came up on my radar,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I felt perfectly comfortable with English.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Though Narrated Books, are a powerful tool for learning English,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and just learning in general.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And this is my recommendation,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">whatever language you are hoping to learn, Narrated Books will get you most of the way there.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To finish it off, you will need to permanently move to that country,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">even if you don't speak the language yet, an mingle and soak up the new culture.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you are not sure which language to pick,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">choose English, because part of the beauty of a language lies lies in the number of countries you can day dream about moving to.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And if you ever take to visit UK,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">whatever you do, leave your fanny pack at home, and do not use the word "fanny" lightly, or at all.</div>
