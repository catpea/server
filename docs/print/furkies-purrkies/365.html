      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">How Your Generation Can End Fraud And Corruption</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This poem is many things, a day dream, a regular dream, a hope, a wish,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a promise, a solution and a problem, a tutorial, and a school of thinking.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Come back to it if you can,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I hope that it will always have something new to offer.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The ultimate goal is to limit how much damage a single liar can cause to a system,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that means computer programs should be used to structure a system.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Humans will always be needed, but in a computerized automated system,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the amount of damage they cause can be greatly limited.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once caught,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the system can be altered to prevent that attack vector from re-emerging.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do not fall into the trap of rule and inference engines,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they are a limited fairy tale, if they did work, they'd replace Linux.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The system architecture is simple, it is just black boxes,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">question in answer out.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It should be written in a language that runs in the browser,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and on the server, so <span>ES2020<sup>[1]</sup></span> at the time of writing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Avoid the Graphic User Interface,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">use a Chat Interface, or a Conversational Interface.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is what this program does,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it answers questions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now, this is a system that will help you launch your company,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it will help you build a school if you are interested in such a thing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but above all this is a system meant to change the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It must be fully accessible to every human being on this planet,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">even the 290&#x2013;363 Australian Aboriginal groups that speak unique languages.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Therefore, before a program is written,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the process must be described in a normal language that can be translated.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once a paragraph captures a point,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a program will be written and connected to it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For example, one may wish to ask:</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Is the three strike pattern in law humane?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A program named "Is the three strike pattern in law humane?",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will be created, and it can be as simple as:</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">function(){</div>
  <div class="paragraph">return {value: false, text:"No."}</div>
  <div class="paragraph">}</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now currently, a lot of people are under the mis-impression</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that if someone shoplifts diapers three times...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They should lose their baby,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and go to prison.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Where prison guards in their madness and stress,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will deny them feminine hygiene products</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in order to demand obedience under the 13th amendment of United States.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our simple program, will immediately cause great upset,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you don't need to be trying to run a small city government.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This question may come up in your first start-up, if you live in a three strike state,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">someone could for example have stolen and sold a laptop, and you are wondering if you should call the police.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So here, we will need another question:</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Should I call the Police?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and again a program named: "Should I call the Police?"</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You see the importance of naming a program after the question,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if the question changes, it will become disassociated from the program, as it will have a different meaning then.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">function(){</div>
  <div class="paragraph">let response = {value: undefined, text:"undecided"};</div>
  <div class="paragraph">const numberOfOffences = await user('How many offenses does the suspect have?');</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if(numberOfOffenses = 0) response = {value: false, text:"No. Do not cause arrest, on first offense."}</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if(numberOfOffenses = 1) response = {value: undefined, text:"Use your own judgment."}</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if(numberOfOffenses = 2){</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if(await answer('Is the three strike pattern in law humane?')){</div>
  <div class="paragraph">response = {value: true, text:"Yes, as the three strike pattern is considered humane"}</div>
  <div class="paragraph">}else{</div>
  <div class="paragraph">response = {value: false, text:"No, as the additional offense will result in imprisonment. Please handle internally."}</div>
  <div class="paragraph">}</div>
  <div class="paragraph">}</div>
  <div class="paragraph">return response;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">}</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So here is a more advanced rule, that features a user call, and a sub-question.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When you await user, the bot you are talking to will ask you a question, like Siri does,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it will ask you a question related to your query, 'How many offenses does the suspect have?'.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Notice that something amazing is happening, the computer is interfacing with you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is asking you a question that it then transforms into a number and uses it in a calculation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It didn't know something, so it used a Human, the Ghost In The Machine,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to figure it out.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let me give you another example just to clarify,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when you need help during self checkout, when something goes wrong, from the perspective of the program,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a human will be dispatched to resolve the problem.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And one more example, <span>The Mechanical Turk<sup>[2]</sup></span> was a chess playing machine,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that from a perspective we need here, used a Human as a CPU.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The Human Heart will forever be more Compassionate, Creative, Loving, and Willing to Change than the best AI,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we are the original thinkers and out-thinkers, we will forever be best at it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In a machine circuit as you see here, the decision making is so limited,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and accountability so easily traceable, that if there is ever any room for corruption here, it will be easily closed.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">At this point, the program prefers to do nothing if there is no offense,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if there is one it leave it up to you, for example if that person is hateful it maybe an idea to file a second offense,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and if they have two offenses then the program will ask it self: 'Is the three strike pattern in law humane?'</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if the answer is yes, then the person will go to prison, if the answer is no it is not humane, then you will be instructed to handle this situation internally.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">These programs are meant to grow,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">perhaps even to tens of millions of lines.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They will look into things based on age,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">based on education level, based on upbringing, and even gang involvement.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Meaning that if the person that stole has been brought up in a gang neighborhood,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then they should not be punished, as they require therapy and un-indoctrination from the culture of taking.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now, listen to this.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A Judge, who hates criminals, because they have tarnished his city,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because that is what everyone else also quietly believes in his courtroom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When he has a bad day, he stubs his toe,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">his coffee is cold, and all the other things fell on his head....</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">He is no longer impartial in the eyes of Justice,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but he likable in the eyes of the city.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">He will now be removed from decision making,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">he will now ask the 10 million line version of the program above, answer some questions,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and now recommend therapy, not more abuse by prison guards and more.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now, The People, which are in charge of a company, school, city, state, nation, and Earth,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will be able to re-run the same calculation the District Judge did.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Will be able to see a story of questions,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and if they find some of those questions unethical, or outdated, then they will begin a social voting process,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to change a particular line of the program.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">At this point, we might as well make amnesty law more common,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and allow those who have been incarcerated under the previous version of the system, to be set free.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As it would be unethical not to,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this too would be a function call, described in the system.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Furthermore, elected officials would be automatically un-elected,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when they cross certain lines, such as failure to meet campaign promises.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As you can see, simple programs CAN fix the corruption of a city,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but they require classroom upon a classroom, school upon a school to focus on their invention.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They require the participation of at least fifty million of young and inspired minds,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the teenagers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The program will grow the same way World Encyclopedia Does,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the petitions to change rules will work the same as the Old White House Petitions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We don't need to create a parallel system to current US law,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">nobody even know how many laws they are, and many are illogical, inconsistent, if not crazy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We just need a system that is better than the courts,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a system that is better than at handling elections and ejections.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A system that grows with us,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a system that is powered by the best in us.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Not for me, not for you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but for the future, because the future requires clear decision-making, and clear and inspired thinking.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Begin studies of ES2020, and begin writing your first program with the use of functions,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or maybe the Event Emitter.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Build it for your own company,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for a school you wished you had,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">build it for the city, state, nation, and the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Don't ask what the future can do for you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but what you can do for the future.</div>
</div>
