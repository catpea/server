    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The League of Extraordinary Ladies</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">At first they laughed, then they called them a cult,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then accused them of corruption, and when it was all over,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">most called them The Founding Mothers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We didn't live under a threat of Nuclear War,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the models predicted the war as 100% certain.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is what happens, when one generation passes onto the next,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Mutually Assured Destruction.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It didn't take computer models,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it didn't require an imagination,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">war only needs time, guns and borders.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For uneducated humans, war is a certainty,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">war is where we all come from.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The models predicted that it would take decades,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">nearly a century to reach a stable disarmament.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One of the greatest problems that Humanity faces is born of group cohesion,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when we lived in tribes automatic self-indoctrination ensured tribe stability.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When the world connected,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">accepting the cultures and beliefs of the local group we were born into, divided us from the rest creating a border.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The threat of nuclear war grew, and it was not disarmament,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but leaving all the bad ideas behind, that would make all the difference.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Abandoning invisible indoctrination and leaving imperceptibly-bad ideas behind,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">can only occur on generation by generation level.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The generations with cultures holding bad ideas needed to retire out of old age,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and a more realistic, more educated, wiser and humane culture, was to take over.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No abrupt changes could be made without conflict,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">out of love for all Life and Humanity this was the first project to require over a hundred years of work.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And so sweetly, one of the girls said, that this would require the work of a League,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The League of Extraordinary Ladies, another one jokingly proclaimed in a grumbly tone.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And the Universe,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">did smile.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The models revealed that Political Borders and Nationalism in a Nation armed with Nuclear Weapons,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">would result in a high probability of a Nuclear War, as each generation is indoctrinated into the worst ideas of the previous.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The most terrifying model prediction was that as more and more got lost in translation between consecutive generations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the probability of nuclear war approached 100%.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And as all Heroines do, The League of Extraordinary Ladies,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">set off on a multi-generational promise, to save the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The weakness, of the ease with which we accept the culture we are born into as true and perfect,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">was going to be addressed by a novel educational program creatively named the Global Progressive Advancement (GPA).</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Volunteers would create free, open, unbranded, library of audio books out of works in public domain,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the website would stitch these works together into Audio Lectures with the aid of speakers, poets and teachers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Celebrities, well known authors, and even movie stars would contribute their time, voice and patience,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to create what became the greatest work of art, that by far exceeded even the most romantic descriptions of the Library of Alexandria.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A number of authors donated their works to the school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">students participating in the free self-paced open-curriculum school had access to Carl Sagan, Bill Bryson, Neil deGrasse Tyson, and pretty much all the others.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">By 2050, it was the only school taken seriously,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because it was the only school that resulted in students showing great results.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The school brought the world together in Knowledge and Wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and as predicted in less than a 150 years from the initial inception, the borders fell.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A new, and more informed, nuclear disarmament program was born,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that decades after resulted in cessation of weapons manufacturing of all kind throughout Europe and Asia.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">These seemingly fantastic, impossible goals of world peace,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">were achieved by helping Humanity converge on wisdom by means of books made more accessible by narrators.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Providing superior education to the children of a nation,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">whilst letting their parents live out culture they were born into,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is a form of Infinite Kindness, it is a form of Love.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Rather than the children inheriting just the culture of their parents and the nation they were born to,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by participating in the Global Progressive Advancement program, they also inherited the best ideas and wisdom from Humanity's most beloved books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">World Peace was reached by taking advantage of our susceptibility to cultural indoctrination,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to blindly and without a question accepting ideas of the world we are born into,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this was not a trick, but much needed medicine and vaccine that prevented mutually assured destruction.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We simply added Knowledge and Wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to the culture and spirit of times, to all the nations.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The first and foremost force of the educational program was not knowledge,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it was Reality, something that corruption and decay is incapable of using for its advantage.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The reality of the human condition is that we all yearn for wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and meaning, and love, and kinship and belonging.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It mattered not if it was two boys that <span>Father Gregory Boyle<sup>[1]</sup></span> was raising,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or two nations that hated each other in starvation for wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once they had access to wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">reality helped to unravel their misunderstandings and helped them grow.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The League of Extraordinary Ladies didn't stop at Nuclear Disarmament,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">their granddaughters ended poverty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They did so by, now the age old tradition of using weakness to fight weakness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they ended poverty by means of poverty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It was a micro management, and micro payment transaction platform,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">distributed on smart tablets that helped communities of the world trade services.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The adoption of the platform was hastened by the fact that no money was made from these transactions by the hosting company,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if someone needed a car ride, or grocery delivery, housework, or a tutor to help their kids with math, there was always someone ten minutes away that would help.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One of the untended features of this program was local pantry,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a feature originally intended for trading foodstuffs, that later became a place to feed the hungry.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The trading platform also helped to place the homeless in unused hotels and apartments,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in such a way that they had easy access to care takers, teachers, therapists and a chance at a better future.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is hard to say what prevented Humanity as a whole from coming together like these friends did,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but it is easy to see that it was internet that helped communities collaborate and communicate better.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We needed programs to help us talk to each other,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and cut out the middle men.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We needed programs that helped cities become more independent,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and stop relying on the state and nation that by contrast meant little.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And we needed to begin thinking in decades,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in centuries.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Because our problems, do not end with us,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and what we leave behind is easily misunderstood.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What was originally created as a deterrent, come future, in chaos, in poverty, in haste,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">given all that is lost in translation, will eventually become the tool that it really is.</div>
