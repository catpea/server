  <p>It may not be possible to grow up,</p>
  <p>on paths that other people want us to walk.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>With each step we take in life we must bloom,</p>
  <p>there have to be audio books and adventures that call our name.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>If we take a single step to the side,</p>
  <p>we will no longer have access to the libraries that move us.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>There won&apos;t be any mountains that will catch our eye,</p>
  <p>everything will become odd.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>Every step we take in life,</p>
  <p>must be higher than the previous.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>It is really sad that some of us get stuck with bad teachers,</p>
  <p>or get attacked by bullies.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>But you know what, that perfect school and perfect life,</p>
  <p>is not really on your path.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>I think a real school,</p>
  <p>is something that we must all build on our own.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>And a perfect life, is a life of rising and learning,</p>
  <p>it is not something that we reach, it is something that we do.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>Wherever you are in life,</p>
  <p>your path is right next to you, and you know it.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>And I know it its probably the hardest path,</p>
  <p>but you know what, the older you will forever admire the moment you get on it.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>Your elder self will sit in a rocking chair,</p>
  <p>old as heck.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>And think back to the moment you started rising,</p>
  <p>and then never stopped, and never looked back.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>And will smile, out of satisfaction of having lived a complete and authentic life,</p>
  <p>the certainty of knowing, that there was just one path, your path.</p>
</div></div>
         </div>
