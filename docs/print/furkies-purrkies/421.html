    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Back To The Future: Reinventing A Smart Smartphone</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Today's smart phones,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">contain disconnected walled gardens and distant islands of functionality.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The design principle revolves around that old apocryphal story,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">where Willie Sutton upon being asked why he robbed banks, responded:</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"because that's where the money is."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is not a design principle,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this has nothing to do with invention.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The leading operating system and phone manufacturers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">have been beat by the little Pine Phone without much of any effort.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And of course, the Pine Phone Operating System,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">being closer to the pure Linux... is far more powerful.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is not just Pine Phone, but also Raspberry PI,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with a 4G modem, UPS/Battery and touchscreen, and a custom case.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Here we have to think in four dimensions, it will be larger,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but with room for extra hardware and the power of a proper desktop.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The Raspberry PI or any Single Board Computer (SBC), is the modular phone,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that people don't yet realize they want.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is not a question of hardware,</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>hardware is a tough business, as Samsung's exploding phones teach us<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To this day Pine Phone, warns that dead pixels on the screen are normal,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and not purchase their phones, if that will cause a return.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Dealing with hardware problems,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is expensive, and doubly so for companies that do not yet have large financial backing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The Raspberry PI and the other SBCs are an exception here,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because you are buying everything a piece at a time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But this _is_ a question of software,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the underlying operating systems must be easy to access.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The phone has to boot the same way that a computer does,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by trapping the users within some abstraction layer the companies destroy the computer.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What this means, is that the company that will bring the computer back,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as in not bother with an alternative GUI, will easily overpower the leading giants.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">An unrestricted Linux device like the Pine Phone, or Librem 5,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">has a lot more to offer than privacy violations, photo leaks and candy crush.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They offer real functionality,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with a world of developers that feel comfortable programming for Linux or BSD.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once the restriction of the Simplified Graphical Shell (like Android or MacOS) is removed,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the underlying operating system will be exposed to real developers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One of the first things people will program are clones of the leading Simplified Graphical Shells,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the simplicity will always be there, but not at restart... it will require the poke of an icon on a real mobile desktop.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Android is just an app on the Linux underneath,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am sure that programmers integrated it far more since, and it is now part of the customized Linux underneath, but it is just a program.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A program that is pushing away real programmers from programming their own way,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and creating a market for phones that don't do that.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That principle of "of I rob banks, because that's where the money is.",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">creates a great weakness for leading smartphone manufacturers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">While they tend to the flowers of their walled gardens,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">phones like Librem 5, and the Pine Phone are letting everyone know that the smartphone market isn't dominated.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is just a couple of companies in a little corner,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">yelling loudly at the sky, while shooting themselves in the foot.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We can't really tell what the real phone will look like,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it needs an evolution, not a shortsighted revolution as we have seen thus far.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I am a Zaurus user, I was already uncomfortable with GUI shell quirks back in mid 2000's,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when the <span>SL-5500<sup>[2]</sup></span> came out.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But, there were no real restrictions,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and I had fun programming it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just because not everyone is into programming,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">doesn't mean that unrestricted access to the OS won't benefit them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There will be a lot more programs,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and a lot more better ideas.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We can see some bubbles of potential functionality forming today,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the conversational user interface, like Siri is an OK-ish idea.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A more chat-room like experience with multiple bots,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">would be even better.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>And there is a friendly programming language emerging already as demonstrated by IFTTT and Zapier<sup>[3]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">though it is far from perfect, it is still somewhat of an improvement over <span>Automator<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">These work flows are just pipes, or even less than that,</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>simple commands as described by Brian Kernighan in the 1982's The UNIX System<sup>[5]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is a lot of user interface to just spell out some commands,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but done correctly, it can work.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The correct implementation of a GUI based work-flow program,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is one that just helps with creating Linux Command Lines, or shell scripts.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And it works both ways,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it can convert shell scripts and one liners to GUI and back.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is nothing special about this,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this has been all thought up by decades ago, except every implementation failed because it had no vision beyond wall gardens and cheap money grabs.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is important to have a round trip from command line to GUI,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and from GUI to command line, because that is how people learn programming.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We witnessed something similar in the view source feature, and not developer console of a browser,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">just being able to match the visuals to the code helps a person learn how to use the code.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The incentive for using code is great,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as using the GUI is many times slower.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The difference is like dragging words from a dictionary,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">vs actually typing them, it takes 10 seconds to find the word in a dictionary and one second to type it out.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Like wise, it takes 10 seconds to find an action in a library of actions,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and just one second to write it's name on the command line.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Then there are your dot files, and user profiles,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you want to have one account on your phone for business and another for home.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When logged in to both,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you can easily switch between the two.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your business account,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will be connected to your business email.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Where your home account will be connected to the family email account,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this means that different login credentials will exist in your profiles.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your business account may use a lot more third party services,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and they have to be kept separate from home related things.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The Automator/IFTT and Zapier like application will be able to see which services you use,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and will offer different sets of actions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is silly that multiple users or profiles can't log into a phone,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">based on a multi-user operating system, frankly it is embarrassing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As to apps, games,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and viruses.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Walled gardens obscure bugs, security by obscurity is a bad idea,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">everything must be open, and eyes must be all over the code.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That is exactly what Linux has right now,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">adding a whole new layer on top of it, even if it is largely open source just expands the attack surface.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The idea of creating a safe app framework, has been proven false time and again,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by app that stole private information from the phone (most recently I heard of a flashlight app ding the stealing).</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I should also note, that creating a single application framework and choosing a single language;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to create all the apps in, is an astonishing display of arrogance, ignorance, and the misunderstanding of the underlying operating system, and all the technological revolutions that brought us were.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One could write a whole miserable book listing all the bad ideas behind that decision,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">here I'll point any lead developers wanting to argue this point to <span>Brian<sup>[6]</sup></span>, as he still seems to enjoy elucidating the novice programmer on that point.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">On a normal linux system, a weather or flashlight app won't track you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">one is a matter of extracting GPS coordinates and making an HTTP request to a weather service, and the other a simple system call.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is no app here, there is no middleman grabbing GPS data,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">just a HTTP curl request to a weather service, dressed up by a local GUI widget, like on a desktop Linux.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is a lot of games that will compile on a standard Linux phone,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there are plenty of frameworks that will do a great job.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">People who want big games need a game console,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">which also should be open, consoles of today suffer from customized walled gardens as means to squeeze every cent out of a customer that already paid.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Apps, is what Linux does, and almost all are free,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">certainly all the good ones, that culture of free open source would continue on the pure Linux Phone as well.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There would be no shortage of apps,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there would be an increase in contributors, and bandwidth donors, and mirrors, and so on.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Predictably, Apps, Games, and Security would be superior to that on leading smart-phones of today,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the increase of care and attention would benefit security on both the desktop and mobile.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Today's leading smartphone platforms,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are just a side road that we'll eventually forget.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Had they stayed in the mainstream,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">their contributions would be more significant and more valuable pushing the evolution of Linux beyond what it is today, past a simplified desktop and into a world where the common user can write programs.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In closing, stay away from hardware,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but know that hardware is simple.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All that is required to bring bout a range of Linux phones,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is to get them without the extra locks and restrictions that cripple the ability to install standard Linux.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Put on a linux friendly distribution, and there is a number of them,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and voila.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just like people are buying the Pine Phone without any advertising on TV,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they would be buying the $100 to $150 no brand linux phones that come in different shapes and sizes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And the advertising comes from social media, from word of mouth,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a cheap no brand pure linux phone that can help the user out program most of the apps in walled gardens, would spread like a wildfire.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In all their programming and years of development,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the leading smartphone platforms achieved nothing to beat 1980's programming powers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In all their programming, or shall we say madness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they only created more attack vectors and sacrificed user privacy, while finding new ways to gag them with ads.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The biggest threat to these giants,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is the bare operating system that they crammed their small minded ideas on...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They robbed the bank, because that is where the money was,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but they also shot themselves in the foot, and now have no leg to stand on, when facing something as trivial as the cute and little $150 Pine Phone.</div>
