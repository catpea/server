  <p>If you are not shaking, and you voice is not broken, from screaming an yelling at the Congress,</p>
  <p>when they called you in for questioning - but they had to drag you out,</p>
  <p>for screaming - about the disgrace of insider trading, and corruption.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Because you couldn&apos;t keep yourself from being a bright dying star,</p>
  <p>out of the potential they held to inspire and move, and educate generations.</p>

  <p>If you aren&apos;t standing at the Diag, making the moron that was just there shaking with anger,</p>
  <p>because you took his microphone, and you started quoting Dawkins, Hitchens, Harris, Dennett, and Ayaan Hirsi Ali,</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Because it is just enough of evil for that particular day,</p>
  <p>and you would, save the sunset by bringing in the Saints.</p>

  <p>And if you never painted you car pink, especially the interior, because the Pepto Bismol didn&apos;t work,</p>

  <p>Why Henry went into the woods at Walden,</p>
  <p>and what happened to Gregor Samsa in Metamorphosis,</p>
  <p>and how beautifully Will Durant opened his Story to Philosophy,</p>

  <p>&quot;Grow strong, my comrade &#x2026; that you may stand</p>
  <p>Unshaken when I fall; that I may know</p>
  <p>The shattered fragments of my song will come</p>
  <p>At last to finer melody in you;</p>
  <p>That I may tell my heart that you begin</p>
  <p>Where passing I leave off, and fathom more.&quot;</p>

  <p>My Friends,</p>
  <p>we are not to live quiet little lives,</p>
  <p>because we only get one each.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>And the way to turn the volume up,</p>
  <p>is to inherit wisdom from all the great beings,</p>
  <p>at all cost at any cost,</p>
  <p>because without their light we can&apos;t tell where we are going.</p>

  <p>Get you audio books ready,</p>
  <p>and listen, just learn,</p>
  <p>listen to all those lives.</p>

  <p>All those great beings,</p>
  <p>are sharing lifetimes of wisdom with you.</p>

  <p>Teach.</p>
