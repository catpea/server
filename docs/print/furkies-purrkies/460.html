    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">A Beautiful Mind</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our minds are already beautiful,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but we can make them even more beautiful.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Simply by standing up,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and refusing to follow, without Knowledge, and Wisdom, and even Greatness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When we follow,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we tend to end up in places that seem strange, if not alien, and it certainly does not seem like we belong there.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">School is like this,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it sneaks up on us.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We go to school and begin waiting and memorizing instead of learning for real,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because everybody else does that too, and we go because our parents went.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We make ourselves and, whatever that career is,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">fit.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But it is never quite,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">where we need to be.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Because when we do not lead,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we are bit by bit pushed off course.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A large part of that,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is that the school never really, truly, fully, gave you a full choice of subjects,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You had to pick from what was available,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and what was available, were subjects that, everyone else was picking.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Not only that, but also, you got, kind of manipulated into not picking some of the classes that interested you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">either the prerequisites were set too high (to filter out low scoring students), or the teacher was iffy (to save money on a real professor).</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The teacher also might have been acting wild, in a friendly way,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and that type of behavior pushes away students that want a stable class, with a predictable and well mannered professor.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You got an impression of choice,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but in all actuality, you didn't even know the fields that would have interested you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That was a promise that would be tucked away behind luck,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if you were lucky to be picked by a prestigious open curriculum university, then maybe.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But even then, you weren't even within the culture (or the slipstream) of achievement,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and whatever culture you could enter, by definition would be incompatible with your unique interests; it would be a culture of bunch of other people.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Socializing is great,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but not in context of greatly multiplying your knowledge and intelligence, so that you have a full picture of the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let me just say,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that greatly multiplying knowledge and intelligence, is what we do as babies, what we do by default.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now, we do need a certain kind of guidance,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">yes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We need to be taken to a Digital Audio Workstation, so that we are introduced to it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and <span>and we need to see someone operating a piano roll<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But this requires,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">27 minutes and 51 seconds.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You see what the problem is,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the poverty of your school takes the piano, away from you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Or Microbiology at its most fascinating,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">actually getting to befriend Tardigrades through your own microscope, through your own eyes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And often,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">just about everything else that is fascinating.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>And they do it by mistake, and out of disrespect and dark ages<sup>[2]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and to make the work of teaching a mass of students, more realistic.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But without the piano,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you don't become convinced that everything is a system of accessible easy to manipulate man-made concepts.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In deed, you are likely to end up being threatened to stop thinking about the piano,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">threatened with prison, the prison of being held back a year.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are constantly nudged off path,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and threatened with shame or punishment when you resist.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Focus on the path ahead,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and ask, what if you were to make informed choices that were precisely your own.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let me define a term here,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">an informed choice is informed by about ten books, though you probably need to read-or-listen-to about fifty, to find those ten.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So here, rather than relying on classes that your school offers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you expand your horizon of possibility...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">and begin relying on enchanting and deeply interesting _to you_,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">narrated books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now. Look, at the road ahead of you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is the road ahead of you not, more customized to who you are?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Precisely because you reached out for books and narrated books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and not; kept yourself boxed in a handful of classes, shame, and creepy threats...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">..that your school offers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because other students tend to pick those most often.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is not to say that there is a conspiracy to deny you knowledge,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but rather that schools are not able to teach you Greatness and Beauty of Mind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For one they don't get enough funding,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but also, Humans Are Stingy, would teachers teach you better, if they got paid more, or would they conserve their strength, and only do as much as strictly necessary.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You should not trust others with your own education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you, should accept the responsibility for it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is a s easy as the <span>Appalachian Trail<sup>[3]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a Thousand Audio Books, and a <span>series of start-ups<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A beautiful mind, is a lot more important than it may seem,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is a great step towards greatness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And Greatness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">makes all the difference.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For a long time now,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the world has been becoming more and more desperate for wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And the only way, the world can grow in wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is when you, and all other human beings on earth accept that challenge.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It gets even more complex, and more urgent,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">some 150 species go extinct every day.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are little over</div>
  <div class="paragraph">2,000 tigers left.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are some 16,000 nuclear weapons,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">of which 2,000 are ready to be instantly launched at densely populated Cities... at the press of a button.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A beautiful mind,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the Greatness that stems from it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">May soon,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">no longer be optional.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Gandhi said that he was inspired in part by Thoreau,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and Martin Luther King Jr, said in turn that he was inspired by Gandhi.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Thoreau himself was inspired by Aristotle,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">who was influenced by Plato and Socrates.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And we need to ask,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">where would we be today without these Beautiful Minds?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What if the Civil Rights movement never happened,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and Cold War ended with the <span>launch of many intercontinental ballistic nuclear weapons<sup>[5]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What if <span>Stanislav Petrov<sup>[6]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">wasn't there to save the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What if <span>Clair Patterson<sup>[7]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">didn't dedicate his life to save us all.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Something as simple as choosing your own path,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so as long as it is towards Beauty and Greatness...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Is infinitely more important than following others, or doing what you parents want you to do,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or getting into a good school.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And you can still do all those things,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but you must choose a Real Education, and Informed Decision-making, and Wisdom, and the Beauty Of Your Mind above all else.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Accepting the responsibility for a fine self education that has no equal,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is the pass less traveled by, it is the choice that makes all the difference.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do not let others push you no matter how little,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">stand your ground, walk your own path, and help the world grow, and inspire others to follow.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Soon all the people who have contributed to the many mistakes that hold us back, will fade away, retire,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the world, will be yours.</div>
