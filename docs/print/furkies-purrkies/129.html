  <p>Of all the filthy creatures from The Baltic Sea to Lake Michigan,</p>
  <p>there is but one I miss and always rejoice to see again.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Never, have I met a creature more Awful and Cheerful than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring-billed_gull">Ring-billed Gull</a>,</p>
  <p>and not a single moment we spent together was any dull.</p>

  <p>The most awful gang, lives over by the Ludington State Park,</p>
  <p>they show up in the morning, and do not leave until dark.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>They are the hungriest, and the filthiest, and the most lovable bunch,</p>
  <p>they live to entertain themselves and steal people&apos;s lunch.</p>
</div>

  <p>If there is one thing that needs to be said,</p>
  <p>it is that they want to <strong>steal</strong> your food and <strong>really hate</strong> being fed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Once, I have seen them gang up on a fool holding up a chunk of bread,</p>
  <p>they all swooped down squeaking, and I worried they&apos;d peck him dead.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Though in the end he was probably fine,</p>
  <p>as I saw him later in the day studying the &quot;DO NOT FEED SEAGULS&quot; sign.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But as long as you let them steal your food,</p>
  <p>they will keep you company, and all will be good.</p>

  <p>I also like those rare Seasoned Parking-lot Pirates that show up in Spring,</p>
  <p>they can fly to any sea or ocean, but they pick a parking-lot; and that&apos;s their thing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>They always seem like they up to something no good,</p>
  <p>probably looking to deliver one of their sick gifts on someones hood.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But, I always feel sad when they fly away for warmer climes,</p>
  <p>they always remind me of strange wilderness adventures and good times.</p>
