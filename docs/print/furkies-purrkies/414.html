    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Of Self Education And Foresight</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is difficult to try to give advice,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that dictates the life ahead, of someone else.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Personally, I would not take out a school loan,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">even if theoretically it would only take four years to pay it off.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To me, those four years matter,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as well as the ten years of mounting debt that lead up to it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I can easily imagine people who don't care about the debt,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and they don't even notice when they pay it off.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">By that time, they become a successful Doctor in their community,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they are admired, and often go on fantastic adventures.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In my mind, the schools must pay their students,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a student should never be put in the position of debt.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Especially student debt that can go up to a million dollars and cannot be forgiven by bankruptcy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there are no guarantees in life, we are too beautiful to be crushed by mounting pressure.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Plus, it is not just about Medical Students or West Point Officers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this practice of putting students in unforgivable debt, applies to a person who just wants to have a nice college diploma.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Student debt is an error,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is not fair for the older generation to stress the future of the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">On top of that, a job or a career,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is just a little thing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our ultimate aim in life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is to become a great being making lasting contributions and leaving an inspirational legacy behind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Life is a one way road,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you can only amplify forward, and you can't ever go back.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All those shortcuts prized by many, really do work,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but in the most terrible of ways.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The wishes of skipping over the hard things,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are granted, as if by the twisted mind of a genie.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A solid shortcut will bridge the youth with old age,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and make the one doing the skipping none the wiser.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As it often is,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the world too has a few tricks up its sleeve.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just like I didn't know to call for help when my bullies came,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because I said to myself, it is my fault, I am fat, I have bad grades, and I wont' fight them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Terrible <span>things may conspire against you too<sup>[1]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and <span>it is hard to catch them before they happen<sup>[2]</sup></span>, it all too easily flies over our heads.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Already, <span>you are likely to be tricked into thinking that education is a chore<sup>[3]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and likely, <span>you have failed to notice that schools are not functioning<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That is what you are up against,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">not only lack of knowledge and experience, but also and <span>overwhelming mediocrity and incompleteness<sup>[5]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Incompleteness of things that you are taught to trust,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and would not ordinary think to question.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Moreover, things are already being stolen from you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>your insight, your brilliance and energy<sup>[6]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>People in authority may try to force you to follow a pre-made way of thinking<sup>[7]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">rather than to encourage you to discover your own, your own path in life is sacred.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And then there are the numbers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>the statistics that reveal the broken promises<sup>[8]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Though it has been a long time,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I still remember feeling that school has been made artificially difficult.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Trickery,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to convince us that it is hard work that works out, if you work hard.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I want you to imagine,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">playing with programming for several years.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And then really try to visualize,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the overwhelming pleasure and excitement, of going to a programming school, having already learned almost everything on your own.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What can be more pleasant,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then a refresher course that meanders through things you enjoy anyway.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And if you forgo the diploma,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">all you need to launch your first start-up is what you have learned on your own.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Going to a school that deal with a specific subject, especially when you are already well educated on the subject,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is what the real school should feel like, learning on top of what you already know, extending your unique strengths.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A school that punishes,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is just fraud.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One of the most <span>painful observations<sup>[9]</sup></span> for me,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is the fact that if we get good at microbiology, we will still fail biology exams.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The range of questions in standardized education is not realistic,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is nothing like learning programming, and then passing all the software development exams at a coder school.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In the average school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you still fail if you are good at something.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The notion of standardized knowledge,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">one arranged by uneducated politicians seeking reelection or promotion is an insult, an affront to the entire world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Pretending to educate has real world consequences,</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>lack of real education is a terrible curse<sup>[10]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We must reject what is broken,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and we must learn to reject the shortcuts.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A school that is not educating its student for real,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is not worth going to even if it offers a diploma, and some promise of a job.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Fraud, is fraud,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it will take you nowhere, and probably put you in unforgivable student loan debt.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Student loan debt is a terrible mistake that must be considered in full ahead of time<sup>[11]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>debt is no fun and it takes a lot of joy out of life<sup>[12]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real knowledge, real education, must come first,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">even if it is self education that then requires going through a program to get it certified.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real education leads to Knowledge and Wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">towards love of life, and it offers a path towards greatness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have to learn to get ahead of those who will trick us,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or <span>things that will put us in debt<sup>[13]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And we have to learn to jump ahead of ourselves,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and ask our elder selves what their regrets are.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">While it may feel that everyone is selling a different version of a solution,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">world's top selling - and beloved - non-fiction books, are still the best way to inherit true wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Best selling books, are in a way voted on by the entire humanity, or entire nations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the overwhelming majority of those books, and especially those that reference each other hold true wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In an age where we can easily get at the narrated versions,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it can't be any easier to accept responsibility for a fine and well balanced self education that fits who we are.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In a world where schools are not teaching,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you will have to educate yourself ahead of time, and only then should you move forward.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Going into a school that is not teaching,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and hoping to graduate, is a mistake.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But, even if you do have a great school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the idea that it will put you into unforgivable debt for any length of time, and in a world that comes with few guarantees - rings an alarm bell.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your life must be lived stress free,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">more than that, it should be lived beautifully.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The journey that real education represents,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is one of the most beautiful things we will experience in life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our progression forward,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is similar to how a flower grows and then blooms.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is very important that the flower is allowed to grow free,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and not be put through stress or drought.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Finally, as much as there is to be said about career choice,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">where, we work, is not everything.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That we grow up and bloom as Great Beings,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and make lasting, positive, and meaningful contributions to the Human Kind is the thing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A job of career by contrast,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is just a little thing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And remember that poverty is an error,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that it is not students who should pay school, but schools and employers that should pay students for the privilege of making their institutions better.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Not only that, but a wise world, a just world, is a world that practices the prevention of stressing or fracturing of its people,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is a world that grants each child a free home, and all the money they will ever require.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In a normal worlds, standardized education is seen as cruel and primitive,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and people learn mostly on their own, but also through a personalized curriculum.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In a real school, there are no teachers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but tutors that never fail to help a curious student find all the answers they need.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do you understand the full scope of considering your own future now,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">not only do you have to face the unknowns, the fraud, the mediocrity and all the unfinished things...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But you also have to consider,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">things not as they are, but as they would be in a well developed and complete, and honest and wise world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The only way to see yourself in time,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is to take to self education, so that you learn about life, before you have to make life changing decisions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One way or another,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">real education, self education, is something that we can't do without.</div>
