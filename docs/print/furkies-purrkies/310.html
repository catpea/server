      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Books</div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you don't like Audio Books, then you are going too fast through life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you have to slow down, all the way down until your Heart begins calling for wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Look, whatever we think we know, is almost certainly incomplete without books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and it takes just a few months to love your way through a hundred of them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Books are always about connection, they will either show you that you are not alone,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or they will sing to you in such a way that you will leap over several of your next plateaus.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Books will make you stronger, more resilient, more courageous,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">more insightful, they will help you see into many of your futures.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The only thing they can't give you is the things you already have,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">like beauty, intelligence, creativity, and majesty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even though you did not live the lives you inherited from within books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you know that they are solid, that the conclusions you draw from them are valid.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is not just about some memories from a book you once read,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is about the kingdom of knowledge within you, an actual city full of roads and libraries.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Each time you read, and re-read as you learn to learn more,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you grow in your modes of thinking, you expand your inner-navigation capabilities.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are really good navigation, be in on the outside, or within out body of knowledge,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but what is a navigator in a tiny city of a few buildings.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The more we expand our city, the more we begin to excel at navigation of greater and greater things,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">be it our personal decision making, or how we relate to other people and the places we aim, to go towards, in life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The bigger our body of knowledge,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the more we can see into the future, the more is the future that unfolds before us connected to us.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Knowledge is is the thunderstorm that backs freedom, that prevents us from being permanently misled,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is the tool that unravels all those things that are inauthentic.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I hope you can make room for wise stories from other lives,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it makes a world of difference.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">May you discover all the world's most beautiful adventures,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and treasures, day dreams and inspirations - and grow, to no end.</div>
