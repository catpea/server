    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Breaking Out Of Indoctrination</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Above all,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">know that this is a process.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Because we are susceptible to false beliefs,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we must always be on a lookout for things that do not seem quite right.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My go to simple example is the fact that we live in a state of Mutually Assured Destruction,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there are about 2,000 ready-to-launch nuclear weapons that can be immediately deployed to destroy the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My extreme example that is really hard to believe,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is wage slavery, most people will deny it, resist it, and call me crazy for it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Having your children living paycheck-to-paycheck always under the cloud of medical and student debt,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is wrong, humanity will not progress in this state.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Of course you can't just believe me,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because that is how problems like this start in the first place.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have to figure it out on your own,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">which is to say, build a path, at a steadily increasing slope, paved with a thousand books written by people wiser than their critics.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The way you find out if a person is wise or not,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is by working your way up to that, by reading books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No one can tell you which books tot start with,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but you can be certain that it is many books, and in the beginning most of them will be narrated for you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The way to find these books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is to dig through best seller lists.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For example right now you may wish to look for top 10 audio books from year 2020,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or for award winning audio books, more specifically look up <span>Audie Awards<sup>[1]</sup></span> (as in a.u.d.i.e).</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Some Philosophers have flaws, but don't throw away their work,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">take it under your wings, make it better.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is a sacred thing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to bring beauty and innocence to some beautiful philosophy once stained by a madman.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In my experience Thinkers are Funny, and Profound,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">sometimes having made mistakes in their youth, is the very thing that launches them into that Love of Wisdom that immortalizes them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So if you find a work of philosophy that is not perfect,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">see if maybe your beauty can restore and fix it, try to save the work; rather than letting the ugly person drag it down into the darkness with him.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Aside from flaws and repairs, or perhaps forgiveness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you will also find that most books will teach you indirectly.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Most of the time, the title has nothing to do what the book is about,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the book will teach you a wisdom that has little to do with the main story.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now, I always encourage non-fiction books, but I don't just mean scientific books, or philosophy and psychology,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think of memoirs and biographies as essential reading.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Here, reading about someone raised in a strange culture or family, can be _absolutely_ the most powerful thing in context of breaking out of some indoctrination.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as the reader will be able to see their own invisible misfortune, by the magic of subtle analogy, to the events in the book that they are reading.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Often, different people reading or listening to the same book,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will get a slightly different story out of it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This relates to the level of their knowledge, to where their curiosities lie,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to the ways that they like to think, and to what they think the book is about.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It it of some importance to add,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that every book a person reads, lifts them higher.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The height that this hints on,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is the same height that Growing Up refers to.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">After a thousand books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it does not matter who took what out of which book.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Or which books or Philosophers they disliked,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or what they thought was under-thought, or could be made better in some way.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">After a thousand books, even after a hundred audio books (and what could possibly be easier than listening to a book on some some fancy adventure),</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a person holds a solid dollop of wisdom in their being.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is like a torch, a lamp,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and it is that light that we use to continuously monitor for more wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Which brings us full circle to the beginning of this text,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you cannot be told what indoctrination you are stuck with, as that is the same mechanism that gets you stuck in the first place.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have to build a wisdom, right in you, in your being,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and that wisdom will enhance your perception, that is why we poetically refer to wisdom as a light - because it helps you see better.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As you continue gathering more and more wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you begin to see more and more, and you become less and less susceptible to false beliefs.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And here I want to close with <span>Plato's allegory of the cave<sup>[2]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the only way that we can truly, and meaningfully, help each other, is with knowledge.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And not with any one book in particular,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but with a hundred, with a thousand, with ten thousand, and fathom more.</div>
