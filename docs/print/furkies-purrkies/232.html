  <p>If loneliness, school, or work has you stressed out,</p>
  <p>and in haste you are slowly forgetting where your lines are.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Here&apos;s a bit of magic for you,</p>
  <p>it will help you separate who you are, from what you choose to do.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Keep a backpack by your front door,</p>
  <p>make sure it is always stuffed full of goodies and ready to go.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Even if it is autumn, or winter,</p>
  <p>and there isn&apos;t anywhere to go.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Keep your backpack by the door,</p>
  <p>it will remind you that you are free,</p>
  <p>and you choose to work hard.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We mustn&apos;t forget that to really sleep,</p>
  <p>we must be rested first, and then wait for the sunset.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>To really wake up, we have to let our body decide,</p>
  <p>we can&apos;t be ripped out of sleep by an alarm.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Each day, must count,</p>
  <p>and add to the previous.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And make us stronger, and wiser,</p>
  <p>and a bit healthier and overall, better.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>If things ever get rough,</p>
  <p>it is high time for adventure.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You drive home,</p>
  <p>but don&apos;t turn off the car.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Pop in just to grab the backpack,</p>
  <p>find a place with decent weather, and ride.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It will take you three days,</p>
  <p>to pull your self back together.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And it will be really hard at first,</p>
  <p>it will feel like you must go back.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But you can&apos;t live a life,</p>
  <p>that is making you lose yourself in haste.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You need to pull yourself together,</p>
  <p>and the first three days are the hardest.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The next three days,</p>
  <p>will show you that you are returning to normal.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You will sleep longer,</p>
  <p>it will feel like a deep breath.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And finally,</p>
  <p>you will relax.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And here after a week or two,</p>
  <p>you will feel much healthier.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Do not push yourself too hard,</p>
  <p>you have to take good care of yourself.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>People that care about you will appreciate your well-being,</p>
  <p>much more than your hard work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>So, a backpack by the door,</p>
  <p>and as a fantastic bonus.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You get to go shopping,</p>
  <p>and shopping is the best form of mediation there is.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Start with mosquito repellent sticks that you light on fire,</p>
  <p>keep them some distance away from your tent.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Figure out what poison ivy looks like and stay away from it,</p>
  <p>leaves of three leave it be, but get some antihistamines and over-the-counter corticosteroid for other bites.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Bring an expensive solar battery charger,</p>
  <p>and backup power-bank meant to recharge your specific cell phone a few times.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Audio books are critical, you must not forget.</p>
  <p>make sure you at least have Bill Bryson&apos;s &quot;A Walk in The Woods&quot; and &quot;Short History of Nearly Everything&quot;.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Don&apos;t forget to get a good Rambo knife, or two, and preferably cut-proof gloves,</p>
  <p>be careful, a sharp knife is often the most &quot;dangerous&quot; thing on your adventure.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You may need a large metal mug for cooking,</p>
  <p>or a cooking-kit, often it is just better to sharpen a stick and have a sausage.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Adventure is the best time to practice your chopstick skills,</p>
  <p>you&apos;ll never need a fork, if any old stick snapped in half will do.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Bring a fancy hat, and some mighty sunscreen,</p>
  <p>don&apos;t let the sun get to you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A trusty headlamp, with some extra batteries,</p>
  <p>will help you in the dark, watch out for owls.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You will need a first aid kit,</p>
  <p>duct tape is your friend here,</p>
  <p>but get bandage and disinfectant too.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Matches, Zippo, and zippo lighter fluid,</p>
  <p>here the fluid will double as fire starter,</p>
  <p>and get some fire starter products like wax sticks and candles.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And you will need some para-cord,</p>
  <p>for easily dragging firewood to your camp.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Get an inexpensive tent, there are some that are very light weight,</p>
  <p>but you are laying down on the ground and your back may not like that.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Some people just travel with a lightweight hammock,</p>
  <p>specifically crafted to replace a tent, so get both, and see which one works out.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You will need a sleeping bag,</p>
  <p>I always bought the warmest ones.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Get a water-bottle,</p>
  <p>and just in case get some water purification tablets.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Toothpaste, toothbrush,</p>
  <p>and toiletries.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Always remember to dangle your food on a few feet of para-cord high up in a tree,</p>
  <p>it will give the cute little Raccoons a workout, an you&apos;ll get to keep your food.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Raccoons are smart enough to fiddle with your tent zipper until they can get inside,</p>
  <p>so get a tiny luggage padlock and lock the zipper eyelets together.</p>
