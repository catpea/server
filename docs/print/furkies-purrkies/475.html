      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Real Education vs. Fake Education</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are not ordinary, nor are you standard, nor should you ever be standardized in any way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you are a sacred being, and you are meant to bring more light to the word.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Be careful,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">do not allow anybody to take away your real knowledge, your real education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is all too easy to fake the teaching of knowledge by tricking students into thinking that they can just do it with memorization,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">schools thrive on it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Schools push you into memorization,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and then use your shame-of-not-knowing-for-real, keep you quiet.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">People who benefit from protecting schools and the fake education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will not have a problem cherry picking data to prove that fake schools are excellent at teaching.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There will be promises, incentives, careers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but in their golden age, students who trusted, yet again, will be, left in want for meaning.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your education is too important,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and is meant to be far too unique to benefit from organized education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just the fact alone that schools do little to distinguish functional knowledge from rote memorization,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">shows that schools are only interested in doing as little as possible.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And simply for the purpose of retaining accreditation to stay stay in business,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so that all the school employees take their paychecks home.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There may not even be an easy way to introduce a real test,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to show everyone that standardized education is fake education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Most people will have to fight to show that they know to get that next promotion,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to keep their job, and not to be ashamed of not knowing basic subjects.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Or teachers can simply come up with the excuse, of not being able to test some fundamental of mathematics,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because it was simply not covered, or; is yet to be covered by university education that not all maybe interested in.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Good liars, make good money, by working in a territory where even their victims will protect the lie,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and above all <span>working within a system of complete deniability where nothing can change<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This would be somewhat OK, if this was some industry, or financial sector,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">smarter investors would stay away from it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But this is the Business of Knowledge,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this is the business of Wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Education deals with the fuel,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that ignites Human Greatness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are; things more important than Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they are all your most brilliant thoughts, deepest integrities, most private treasures, and your very decision making.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They too are influenced,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by what we know, our greatest treasures, can be warped and sometimes stolen by fake education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What we know influences who we are,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so we really have to make sure that the things we know are authentic, true, real.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We must not trust anybody with our own education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is far too dangerous, it is actually careless.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do net let people trick you into a fake education and switch real knowledge for fake one, cutting you away from your Wisdom and Greatness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so that they can pinch away a little bit of money from a lot of uneducated people.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are meant to become a Royalty,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you are meant to Enlighten the World, and push it away, from the mistakes it keeps making.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Humanity has invented books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">which are a way of transferring precious hard earned knowledge that must never be lost.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The top 1,000 books written by all the world's authors, from many nations, across many cultural and political epochs and revolutions,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">especially those that admire one another in high esteem, will give you a safe, and well-balanced view of the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The type of knowledge that life changing books contain,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">has the ability to enhance and-build-up our minds, help us grow-up higher, and become wiser, onward to Greatness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This powerful mind enhancing power, inherited from countless lives committed to Authentic Knowledge, Meaningful Wisdom and World Improving Greatness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is for you, it is your treasure.</div>
