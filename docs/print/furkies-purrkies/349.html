      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Get Mad: Of High School And Music</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In today's episode,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we get mad at High School and Music.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We use songs as an example of a thing...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that the first semester of music class should teach you how to make.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I want you to think about a website, with an album of 10 songs,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that your customers can buy, or license from you for their business use.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Music is simple, elevator music is so simple it is automatically generated,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so is brainless video music that plays in the background.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Underwhelming workout music, that people kind of prefer,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is little more than background music.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So, from now on when you hear brainless music, void of soul and love,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">get mad, at your teacher and say:</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"Don't waste my time, don't make me memorize.",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if you want to teach, teach me something complete and useful, wrapped in a small business.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When they kick you out of class for being disruptive,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">stay mad, and <span>babble something madly and awkwardly<sup>[1]</sup></span> under your nose, don't give up.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If the world governments really believed that you were the future of their nation,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they wouldn't be putting you in debt for higher education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If teachers were really interested in nobly educating you out of their goodness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they would have never <span>allowed book publishers to cheat you<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If schools were on your side,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">student debt would never have existed in the first place.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Student debt forgiveness is not enough,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a school that charges money has a conflict of interest, it will simply educate less and aim to profit more.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Get mad, you can always go back to school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but you will not always have an opportunity to focus all your attention on some amazing experiment.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I mention music because it is everywhere,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and if music class really did teach music, we would all be able to create songs.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is just Drums,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Bass, Chords, and Melodies.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Music Theory is not difficult either when taught right,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with simple emphasis on the Circle of Fifths and focus on examples in <span>lmms<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If schools really cared to help you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they would help you find and fund a path towards a small business.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Such as the creating of workout music,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and sale of workout programs.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">At the end of the first year of high school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you would not be getting a grade, but your first business.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And you would experience making your first $100,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the next year you would have a second, and third and fourth.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Some of your best customers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">would be kids from your school.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Music is really useful when creating videos, documentaries,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">workouts, commercials, presentations, you name it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Because you are right there,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they would be licensing lots of material from you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And this would continue on,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the word would spread, your little company would reliably make a little bit of money.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Get mad, because your time is precious,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and nobody should take advantage of your inexperience, by acting high and mighty, all the while <span>selling you out for a small paycheck<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Get mad, because you deserve a real and functional education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that enhances your predispositions, not cookie cutter classes that attack you for having unique interests.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We all face poverty, and we are given this idea of going to college and making money,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but college took upon it self to actually puts us in debt, shove us into the minus.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And allow others to nibble some more,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"a debt that cannot be removed with bankruptcy", "a predatory textbook business model" - are you kidding me?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Get mad, because you are being handed lemons,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and forced to drink the lemonade, that the school convinces you, that only they can teach you how to make.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is time to stop pretending to learn by cramming for tests and memorizing material,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and time to start asking questions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And what is this grade and GPA nonsense?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">grades are not real just for the fact that tests can be crammed for, they only reflect forgotten memories.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even the Dean's List seems like a scam when you have to pay for lectures,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it just gets the students to play the charade some more.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Music class, to give you a simple example,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">must enable every student to make music.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">On the final day of the first semester,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">everyone needs to know how to make songs with lmms.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is that simple, music class teaches you to make music,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if you can't make an album of songs, then you just got tricked.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your time is precious and is not to be wasted, and let me tell you something,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">get mad, because the teacher sure took a bunch of money home for pretending to teach you.</div>
