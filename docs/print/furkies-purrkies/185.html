      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Of Mountain Ranges And Tipping Points</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When you gather a comfortable amount of observation,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there is a moment when you go from observer to creator.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is similar to how you arrive in a new city,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">at first you are unsure, but eventually it becomes your home town.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In politics, politicians so through something similar,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but it is a mistake, they become comfortable around manipulators,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and get comfortable with manipulating, propagating the blight.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In the world of books, the authors that resonate with you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">become your friends, Carl Sagan, Bill Bryson, Dan Brown,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they become family and you get to know them in your own way.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In world adventures, it is called going native, or emanating mana,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">one moment you are an outsider, and the next you are riding a bull to work,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">where you spend your days working hard on digging new wells,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">hurrying to finish before your visa expires and you have get back to the loud and filthy city.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When knowledge becomes internalized, it becomes wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you become able to synthesize more knowledge out of what you already know,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">some call it Enlightenment.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It all cases, it is natural, human, simple and easy to get to,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is not rare, it is not a power granted only to special people,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is a power that makes people more special.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you read enough audio books that move you in the same direction,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you'll go from listening about something to becoming a participant in thinking about it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is a feeling so powerful at first,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that some become convinced they are geniuses,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and have deeper knowledge</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"Nope! that's just your first tipping point dude,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">keep going though, because you are just about as amazing as you think you are, don't stop learning".</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The more tipping points, and plateaus,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">upon which we rests as we move towards the sunny parts of our mountain range.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The more capable we become, the more we can synthesize,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the more of the things we synthesize slowly do become unique and amazing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Finally, the more we know,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the easier it is to understand other people's works,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we begin sharing more and more with other creators.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That's Real Education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we become specialists in our own unique corners of the world,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Eventually we too get stung by the urge to share what we know,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">both the unique little discoveries or contributions we made,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and in memoirs that describe all the twisty little passages that got us there.</div>
