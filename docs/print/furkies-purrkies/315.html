  <p>Each Human Being,</p>
  <p>Must Become Wise.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>You are a Child of the Universe first,</p>
  <p>and within you is a unique constellation of thoughts.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>Our world needs those thoughts to evolve into a nebula of wisdom,</p>
  <p>so that Humanity may progress forward without repeating simple mistakes.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">

<div class="section">
  <p>Your growing up is sacred,</p>
  <p>you must not be interrupted.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>If people come to hurt your mind,</p>
  <p>you must rise and protect yourself.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>It matters not, if they are misguided,</p>
  <p>or if their harm is deliberate.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>Your mind must grow,</p>
  <p>your decision-making must improve daily.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>You have to learn about Life, and Universe,</p>
  <p>about what it means to be Human.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>We are one family,</p>
  <p>each a child of the universe, deserving freedom, justice, equality, dignity, knowledge, and wisdom, and greatness.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>No one is to belittle you,</p>
  <p>treat them as a danger, and keep your mind safe.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>When something goes wrong in your community, or school, or even group of friends,</p>
  <p>leave them, you are not going to be able to change their minds, and you have your own path to walk.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>No one being is better than the next,</p>
  <p>you are not to compare the value of your own life against others, nor is anybody else allowed to make that comparison.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>You have to find a place where you are safe, where you can put your journals away,</p>
  <p>where you can dream and let your imagination roam free.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>No one is allowed to push you around,</p>
  <p>your path is sacred, and you can only walk your own.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>You must continue growing up, and never stop for any reason,</p>
  <p>because the less you know the easier it is to trick or mislead you.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>No one is allowed to make you think that you are not smart,</p>
  <p>especially not teachers who are tricking you into thinking memorization has anything to do with learning.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>You are not to be manipulated into mistakes,</p>
  <p>so that someone can prove to you how correct they are, and how you should listen to them.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>No one is allowed to make an example out of you,</p>
  <p>as your life, body and mind is just as sacred as everybody else&apos;s.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>You have to understand the way Humanity progresses, and regresses,</p>
  <p>and see what you can do to help them along.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>No one is allowed to lie to you, for any reason,</p>
  <p>not mom, not dad, neither leaders nor fools.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>You are not to give away anything precious, from smiles to love,</p>
  <p>because everything that matters to you, is so precious that it must be earned.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>No one is to use chores as a way to control you,</p>
  <p>it is your choice to help, or not.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>You are free, and no one is allowed to take that freedom away,</p>
  <p>you must always be treated with dignity, especially if you feel you don&apos;t deserve it.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>No one is allowed to make you feel unwell, or scared, or small,</p>
  <p>the world needs you to grow uninterrupted.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>And you should connect with Nature, and Nature Trails, so that they may slow you down,</p>
  <p>you should own a backpack and a tent, and every once in a while sleep under the stars.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>You are not alone, not are you at any disadvantage,</p>
  <p>nor will you miss something, that you will later regret.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>You are not the first person to be uncomfortable with the world around you,</p>
  <p>in fact most of the beautiful things that you like, are created by those who did not give up their mind, who did not give in.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>There are many quiet little paces and things that can help you grow,</p>
  <p>things like audio books, free libraries, college art classes, and even poetry slams, long adventure trails, and hacker, and maker spaces.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>Begin listening to all audio books you can find,</p>
  <p>do not let anybody stress you into inaction.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>Just avoid them, there is no communicating with people who will dismiss everything you say,</p>
  <p>no matter what it is.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>It is all happening to you, because the world is full of people who think they are grown-ups, but have actually fallen behind on growing up,</p>
  <p>they are what would happen to you if you never had another beautiful thought, and never read a book, only aged to look like an adult.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>Take good care care of yourself,</p>
  <p>become a poet, a writer, artist, musician, dancer, trail runner, athlete, adventurer, intellectual, humanitarian, philosopher... a visionary, a human, and a great being.</p>
