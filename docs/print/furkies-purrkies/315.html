    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Each Human Being,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Must Become Wise.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are a Child of the Universe first,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and within you is a unique constellation of thoughts.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our world needs those thoughts to evolve into a nebula of wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so that Humanity may progress forward without repeating simple mistakes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your growing up is sacred,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you must not be interrupted.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If people come to hurt your mind,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you must rise and protect yourself.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It matters not, if they are misguided,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or if their harm is deliberate.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your mind must grow,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">your decision-making must improve daily.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have to learn about Life, and Universe,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">about what it means to be Human.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are one family,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">each a child of the universe, deserving freedom, justice, equality, dignity, knowledge, and wisdom, and greatness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No one is to belittle you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">treat them as a danger, and keep your mind safe.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When something goes wrong in your community, or school, or even group of friends,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">leave them, you are not going to be able to change their minds, and you have your own path to walk.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No one being is better than the next,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you are not to compare the value of your own life against others, nor is anybody else allowed to make that comparison.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have to find a place where you are safe, where you can put your journals away,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">where you can dream and let your imagination roam free.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No one is allowed to push you around,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">your path is sacred, and you can only walk your own.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You must continue growing up, and never stop for any reason,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because the less you know the easier it is to trick or mislead you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No one is allowed to make you think that you are not smart,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">especially not teachers who are tricking you into thinking memorization has anything to do with learning.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are not to be manipulated into mistakes,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so that someone can prove to you how correct they are, and how you should listen to them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No one is allowed to make an example out of you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as your life, body and mind is just as sacred as everybody else's.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have to understand the way Humanity progresses, and regresses,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and see what you can do to help them along.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No one is allowed to lie to you, for any reason,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">not mom, not dad, neither leaders nor fools.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are not to give away anything precious, from smiles to love,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because everything that matters to you, is so precious that it must be earned.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No one is to use chores as a way to control you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is your choice to help, or not.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are free, and no one is allowed to take that freedom away,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you must always be treated with dignity, especially if you feel you don't deserve it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No one is allowed to make you feel unwell, or scared, or small,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the world needs you to grow uninterrupted.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And you should connect with Nature, and Nature Trails, so that they may slow you down,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you should own a backpack and a tent, and every once in a while sleep under the stars.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are not alone, not are you at any disadvantage,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">nor will you miss something, that you will later regret.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are not the first person to be uncomfortable with the world around you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in fact most of the beautiful things that you like, are created by those who did not give up their mind, who did not give in.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are many quiet little paces and things that can help you grow,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">things like audio books, free libraries, college art classes, and even poetry slams, long adventure trails, and hacker, and maker spaces.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Begin listening to all audio books you can find,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">do not let anybody stress you into inaction.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just avoid them, there is no communicating with people who will dismiss everything you say,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">no matter what it is.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is all happening to you, because the world is full of people who think they are grown-ups, but have actually fallen behind on growing up,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they are what would happen to you if you never had another beautiful thought, and never read a book, only aged to look like an adult.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Take good care care of yourself,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">become a poet, a writer, artist, musician, dancer, trail runner, athlete, adventurer, intellectual, humanitarian, philosopher... a visionary, a human, and a great being.</div>
