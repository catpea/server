  <p>Existentialists say that we must give our existence a meaning,</p>
  <p>we are not to accept what we are told to become.</p>

  <p>Evolutionary biologists say there was once a need to listen to the elders,</p>
  <p>it helped tribe cohesion, it got the younger ones on fast track.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Atheists say that we are not to mistake myth for reality,</p>
  <p>no matter how comfortable it makes us feel.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>Scientists teach us to question everything, reproduce previous results,</p>
  <p>to be skeptical and free of biases, and never put opinion over fact.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>Schools are actively trying to convince us that memorization is superior,</p>
  <p>to looking something up.</p>

  <p>At work we get less for more,</p>
  <p>until we are replaced with a younger employee that costs them a fraction.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And everywhere we are bombarded with falsehoods, broken promises, half-truths,</p>
  <p>and things that are too good to be true.</p>

  <p>All of this added together begs that we take control of our life,</p>
  <p>it is safer to think for ourselves, than to have somebody else think for us.</p>

  <p>Let us stop following advice,</p>
  <p>unless we know for certain that it is wise advice.</p>

  <p>When we are told to become a Doctor or a Lawyer,</p>
  <p>let us turn the table around and reply:</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>&quot;No, that&apos;s what you want,</p>
  <p>and that&apos;s what you should do.&quot;</p>

  <p>And let us begin building ourselves from ground up,</p>
  <p>with all the wisdom that we can find - from libraries; to great little adventures.</p>

  <p>There are too many people that stand to get something out of you,</p>
  <p>if you listen to them, and do what they want.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You have to do what you want, and the best way to figure out what that is,</p>
  <p>is by inheriting many lifetimes of knowledge from fascinating books.</p>

  <p>You are too complex to follow a single thing that someone tell you to follow,</p>
  <p>you need to stitch your body wisdom out of hundreds of wise books and build your own way.</p>

  <p>Take good care of your mind and body, and be mindful of the fact that as you become wiser,</p>
  <p>your horizons will broaden, and what you once thought impossible will become easy.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>The wiser you become the more open gateways will appear before you,</p>
  <p>think by subtle analogy to your childhood, how small your world was back then, and how big it is now.</p>

  <p>With more wisdom your world will become even bigger,</p>
  <p>so please don&apos;t worry that you are stuck.</p>

  <p>You are not stuck, so as long as you read and learn from wise books,</p>
  <p>the wisdom you need is well on its way to enlighten you and your path.</p>
