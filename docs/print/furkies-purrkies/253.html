  <p>When you think about life decade by decade,</p>
  <p>you can see that it is best lived by following an upward slope.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Each decade should be powerful for us,</p>
  <p>it should propel us forward and beyond.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We must really take the time to consider what is important,</p>
  <p>what is it that our elder selves may regret not having done.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Life does come with an instruction manual,</p>
  <p>it is all the Audio Books that will interest you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>From Memoirs, to Adventure, and Science,</p>
  <p>and also reading in-between the lines.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Above all, we must take good care of ourselves,</p>
  <p>life is not meant to be lived in stress, or fear, or at a great speed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>This is how we can understand those books,</p>
  <p>and learn from them and inherit their wisdom.</p>

  <p>We are each a miracle of the universe,</p>
  <p>the GPA, the championship or scholarship, just does not matter.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Listen to those words,</p>
  <p>IT DOES NOT MATTER!</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Because you are already more,</p>
  <p>than any of that made up stuff!</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is not the brand of education that matters,</p>
  <p>what matters, is that your education, brought you wisdom!</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>With wisdom, if you still need to,</p>
  <p>you will build your own Firm, or Company, or School.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Pursuit of Wisdom, guarantees that as each decade passes,</p>
  <p>you will grow in Greatness.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>With Wisdom, and the transcendence of limits it entails,</p>
  <p>come our golden age, we will become far more, than we thought possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The most prestigious degree, is the honorary degree,</p>
  <p>where a University goes out of its way to deliver it to you,</p>
  <p>for all your achievements, and the goodness you brought to the World.</p>
