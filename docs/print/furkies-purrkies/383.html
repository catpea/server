    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Programming is simple, friendly, rewarding, fun, and relaxing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it will set you free from poverty and drive you to make the world a better place.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">People who think it is funny to say that,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are that people that brainlessly walked into some high stress meat-grinder and now hate life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As with everything else, if you are forced to learn programming,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and forced to program under a threat of bankruptcy and poverty it will seem awful.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One of our first responsibilities in life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is t push toxic people and environments away.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is nothing negative in the world of programming,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is an art like everything else.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just like it is not perfect, to sit down to learning how to paint with a cup of tea or coffee as paint,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and paper that is not really all that good for water colors, and a brush that could be better.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have to assemble your programming environment with a kind of love,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and you will need a mascot to keep you company and for <span>Duck Debugging<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It does not need to be a duck,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I have a Fuggler, the Red Suspicions Fox, and I called him Boo Boo, or Boobs for short, after an angry dog I like.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your computer should be the <span>8GB Raspberry Pi 4 Model B<sup>[2]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>maybe get a Raspberry Pi 400 as your secondary<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You will need a monitor, keyboard, mouse,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and possibly an external drive.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I would recommend that you get a simple monitor,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the raspberry PI supports two 4K monitors but all of that is overpriced.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Consider getting a <span>mechanical keyboard<sup>[4]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">perhaps <span>AKKO<sup>[5]</sup></span> or <span>Anne Pro<sup>[6]</sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your programming language should be ES2021, or whatever year you are in,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this is the evolving JavaScript language.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I know many programming languages,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but I don't have time to use them all, there is no point in learning a language that you will not use 5 years from now.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have to learn the language of the web,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it works in the browser, in application frameworks like <span>Electron<sup>[7]</sup></span> or <span>p5.js<sup>[8]</sup></span> or <span>Tone.js<sup>[9]</sup></span>, and on the server, and your Raspberry PI.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You will need to install <span>Node.js<sup>[10]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and search internet videos for <span>node.js tutorials<sup>[11]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But, above all you need a reason,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">something you are or can be passionate about.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And it has to be something that many people can work on at the same time,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so something inspired by WikiWiki the program that inspired MediaWiki behind Wikipedia.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">See the point is to allow strangers to come in and contribute to your program,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by just clicking EDIT, without signing up for anything, without giving their email.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I am gratly inspired by the SCP Wiki,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">even though it is not a computer program, though it is a kind of a game, or a kind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just this morning I was reading about <span>SCP-087<sup>[12]</sup></span> and I didn't finish, I stopped at Document 087-I,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the hell with it all, I actually had to turn my lights up.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">See multiple people are contributing to a single story, or - an almost a game,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and that is the platform that you must start with.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You will have to program your own WikiWiki,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and allow people to enter code into it via <span>CodeMirror<sup>[13]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I can't tell you what your project should be about,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but it should contain <span>your own take on BDD<sup>[14]</sup></span> so that you can focus on sketching and let others code it for you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Behavior Driven Development<sup>[15]</sup></span> or BDD for short, describes computer programs in plain English,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">leaving it to programmers to fill in what is broken.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">BDD is very simple,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but I am yet to find a simple explanation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">BDD is about writing stories about your program,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">these stories describe what is going on, what is about to happen, and what should be the result.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If what happened does not create the expected result,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then you will know that part of your program is either broken or unfinished.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us begin programming a simple game,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">where squirrel eat peanuts.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">First we describe the world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There is a peanut on the ground, a tree, a squirrel in the tree, and she is really hungry.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In the world of computers you have four <span>objects<sup>[16]</sup></span> here:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">peanut, ground, tree, squirrel.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The squirrel has a property of hungry,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">since our story seems to hint on a squirrel that can be a bit hungry, rather than a true or false, lets make the property a percent.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Since we don't want to do any special math,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we will express percent as a fraction between 0 and 1, where zero is not quite hungry but may eat something, and one is really hungry and about to pass out for a little while.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let's tidy up the place a bit, and create a world for our objects,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so now world contains ground, ground contains peanut, and tree, and tree contains squirrel.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In computer world there are primitive variables like number or fraction,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but also complex variables like objects that can contain a primitive like hungry, or list like inventory.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Though it is tempting to think of everything as a variable,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">don't do that too much.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">An object is a perfect and precise thing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">though it can contain a list, don't think of it as a singe unit, where you set it and forget it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In the world of databases, in order to allow billions of records,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you really want to keep objects and lists separate, and load their data separately and treat each with respect.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The kind of thinking where you say I created a squirrel with a number expressing hunger and an inventory list that may hold a peanut is too simple,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and won't translate well to databases.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just think of it as an object with properties, that also has a list called inventory,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">not object with properties where one of the properties is a list, be respectful of data structures, keep them loosely coupled.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If everything becomes too tightly bound,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you will cut yourself off from easily speaking to simple databases.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now that we have a world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we know that the squirrel isn't doing anything.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is just really hungry,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is like world without anything going on.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So now we have to describe some action,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">something that will cause a change.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If we were just writing a normal story in an essay,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we would first describe the world, and then what was going on in that world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Same thing is happening here, but the two things STORY CONTEXT, and ACTION EVENT, must be kept separate,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and we have to be serious about this, because somewhere down the road we may add a new ACTION EVENT, that reuses the story so that we can test something else.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The STORY CONTEXT will stay the same,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we will only add an ACTION EVENT, or a hundred of them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If we keep out BDD nice and tidy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if we are keeping context separate from action, it will all be very easy to understand.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So in this ACTION EVENT,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we'll just make the squirrel simply notice the peanut, jump down from the tree, and put it in her little cheek.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And that is it, but this is a lot,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because now, the tree no longer contains the squirrel, the ground no longer contains the peanut, all kinds of things have changed.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So now we add the OUTCOME TEST,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this is what BDD, and all this crazy story writing is about.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We now describe the state of the things in the stuck-a-penut-in-her-cheek world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and if the program does not behave the same way as the outcome, we know that it is unfinished or broken, and can send a programmer in here.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our test of outcome must at least describe that the peanut and squirrel have moved,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that the squirrel is on the ground and the peanut, well, is in the squirrel, we don't care if cheeks or in her stomach, we don't care if the peanut is whole, or crunched up.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The little details are unimportant to our game,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">nobody cares to test these details, nobody cares to pay programmers to test them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Think of it as doing scientific research, and trying to figure out what the structure of DNA is,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if you come across another molecule, one that is not the point of your research, you just don't pay attention to it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To give some structure to what is basically text,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">BDD developers came up with a language that sort of everyone agrees on using.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just to be precise of what is what, the story description starts with the word given, the action description starts with the word when, and the outcome description starts with the word then.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So, given, when, then,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">given this type of a world, when this thing happens, then this stuff should be true.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When other programmers read your BDD they will be familiar with the Given, When, Then method of story writing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and will continue playing along so that now you are going to be able to read any new tests they add.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us describe our squirrel story in BDD syntax now,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Given the world has squirrel in a tree</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the squirrel is really hungry</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And there is a peanut on the ground</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When the squirrel notices the peanut</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then the squirrel leaves the tree</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And gets on the ground</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And puts the peanut in her cheek</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When the squirrel eats the peanut,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then the squirrel is no longer really hungry.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Note how I added a second when, where the squirrel actually ate the peanut,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I actually reused the STORY CONTEXT, I just added a new action event.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Also note that I chain things with the word "And" as in:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the squirrel leaves the tree, AND gets on the ground, AND puts the peanut in her cheek.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This syntax exists for the purpose for keeping BDD programs simple,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">dealing with English text is a difficult problem, but if we just patiently take that one extra step and use Given, When, Then, and And, it makes a world of difference.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I don't want to tell you this as not to mix anything up,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but personally, I kind of think of this syntax as a subset of English, one that is just used amongs us the programmers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Yes,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you are a programmer now.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And now you may wish to ask,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">well how the heck do I run this thing?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Is there a program?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and how will it know about squirrels?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You will have to write two programs to run the squirrel world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">first is the game that we are describing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And the second, is a testing framework</div>
  <div class="paragraph">where we will import the game, and pretend we are a player, while running the tests.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The types of games that deal with Squirrels, or Virtual Worlds for that matter, are called <span>MUD<sup>[17]</sup></span>s,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or Multi User Dungeons, or Multi User Dungeons Object Oriented.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Writing a MUD is a fun way to learn programming,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you can probably do it in 20 lines of code, but you may actually fall in love with programming mini worlds, and grow them to a million lines of code.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you are not into computer games,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then you should know a mud can be used to generate poetry.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For example imagine, that the world exists in a poet's mind,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and when the game is executed for real, the squirrel will examine its environment, while muttering something about leaves and trees,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and then rhyme something poetic about peanuts, hunger, and how they are crunchy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Here is one such program called <span>limerick<sup>[18]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it took no effort to create it, it was just a lot of fun.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once you write a tiny MUD,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then you create a program called test, and import your world as a module.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And begin executing the BDD tests,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you load up the story file we created, and just parse beginning with the first line:</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"Given the world has squirrel in a tree."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You instruct your MUD to create a new world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">create a tree object,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">create a squirrel object,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and then add the squirrel to tree.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now you just move onto the second line,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And the squirrel is really hungry"</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">so you set the hunger value of the squirrel object to 1,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or maybe energy value of squirrel to 0.01, meaning it is running out of energy and only food can restore it in context of this game.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And continue on,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when you develop your MUD you define plants, trees, animals, so it is really easy to just get them in here and set them up for the purpose of this test.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The way you parse a line of text, that you loaded from a file is kind of unusual in BDD systems,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">what you want to do is create a tiny program precisely named after the line, so if the line changes the program becomes dissociated, it goes away.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The easiest way to associate a program with "Given the world has squirrel in a tree.",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is just creating a function or a file named after the slugged version of this sentence, to make a slug, is to lowercase everything and replace spaced with hyphens, simplify it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Another way, is to use <span>regular expressions<sup>[19]</sup></span>, JavaScript has named capture groups now,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so regular expressions are much easier.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Here is an <span>example of a regular expression in the wild<sup>[20]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">parsing the sentence and variations of "What are the three laws?", see line number 26.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As you are learning programming,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">do what feels right for you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Personally, this would be where I'd take a moment to grok regex once and for all,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">regular expressions are used on the Unix command line as well, so you'd be learning something that is useful in other places.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are plenty of <span>Regular Expression Visualization Tools<sup>[21]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so you can see how the matches are occurring.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you don't feel right about learning regex,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">don't do it, it is an acquired taste.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think a lot of people just google <span>regex how do I match email address<sup>[22]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and just go with the results until they start seeing patterns and finally take the plunge.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In terms of how frequently you use that kind of thing in programming,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">not often, instead of matching something to recognize it, you really want to specify a type for the thing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Take a look at how I create pages of YouTube videos<sup>[23]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">instead of searching for something that looks like a youtube id, which is costly in terms of CPU cycles...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I state "type: youtube",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and there is no question that the id that follows is a video id.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But when you are dealing with something like parsing English in a BDD line of text,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then regular expressions are worth the CPU cycles, and the trouble.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The thing that Regular Expression are used for in BDD statements,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is fishing out variables.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So when we say "And the squirrel is really hungry.",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the word "really" specifies how hungry the squirrel is.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Regular expressions really shine here if we have multiple things to match,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and now that Regular Expressions have named capture groups, you can actually see what a particular pattern is after.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Basically, once you take a bunch of JavaScript and node.js tutorials,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you are going to need some interesting ideas.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Writing your own WiliKiki is a great idea,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">until you are finished writing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To make it useful,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or even to make a business inspiration out of it, you have to make it do something useful.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To make it fascinating,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you have to open it to the world so that others can edit your program.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is up to you to figure out how to bless that alien code,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">look at he way software on github grows, when someone writes new code, it is sent to the program's owner as a request to merge code.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This way everything is submitted in small readable chunks,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and gets reviewed without much confusion.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Creating a text game, where thousands of people can edit the story,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and then enter the world and watch others solve the puzzles they created can be a fun little project.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Something more advanced and more business minded,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">can be a WikiWiki that uses Tone.js to create a clone of the Leading Digital Workstation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is really difficult to write large programs by yourself,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but if you have thousands of contributors, some working for tips, for bounties, or big prizes then a large program can be made pretty quickly.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The issue of managing hundreds of thousands of tasks and thousands developers becomes greatly simplified,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when you use something like BDD, especially BDD that has been finely tuned to your program.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Programmers write programs for self education and fun,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but when it comes to large applications, learn from the success of the World Encyclopedia.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is very difficult to inspire you to a program you may wish to create,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I can't really help you with dreaming it up.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But I can show you how to do it in such a way,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so that other programmers may join you for fun or some meaningful reward.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Whatever it is build it a page at a time,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">combine WikiWiki with BDD, maybe MUD, and make the story more important than the code as demonstrated by <span>Literate programming<sup>[24]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Programming is just another form of art,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">just learn at the pace that fits you best, and in a sequence that matches what you already know, without anybody timing you or telling you what to learn.</div>
