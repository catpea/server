  <p>Our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">cognitive biases</a>,</p>
  <p>will only keep causing trouble for as long as we are unaware of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Eventually, new, fully functional educational systems,</p>
  <p>will help us to Knowledge and Wisdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>As we learn to trust computers,</p>
  <p>we will learn to stop relying on easily corruptible career politicians.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The educated voter democracies of the future,</p>
  <p>will stand as powerful machines helping us manage our cities and Earth with the wisdom of the crowds.</p>

  <p>The world before us lost 99% of its species,</p>
  <p>the climate is ever changing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The layer of oxygen we all rely on is extraordinary thin,</p>
  <p>and most of earth is Ocean and the rest requires that we protect ourselves from elements.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>While we are bound to this planet chemically,</p>
  <p>Earth never really relied on us for anything.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We are not the destroyers, not is Earth,</p>
  <p>we are simply yet to be fully awakened caretakers and maintainers.</p>

  <p>We need a more powerful educational system,</p>
  <p>one that reaches deep into all corners of Humanity,</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>From Yawanawa, Romani, Maasai, Samoyeds, Rotumans, and Hawaiians,</p>
  <p>we all have to come together now as a single family.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>What must connect us, is education,</p>
  <p>which is just a path to Knowledge and Wisdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Whoever we are, and whatever we think we are doing,</p>
  <p>we are made much better by inheritance of Knowledge and Wisdom,</p>
  <p>which in turn begets Compassion, and Empathy, and the very cure for our Cognitive Biases.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The Love of The Human Family,</p>
  <p>and the Insight and Understanding it entails.</p>

  <p>It is OK to have made mistakes,</p>
  <p>it is just our cognitive biases,</p>
  <p>and lack of education, and poverty, and fear.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But it is not OK to stay within the confines of those mistakes,</p>
  <p>Earth needs our help, the animals need our help too,</p>
  <p>and we can&apos;t help them without Education and the Unity it entails.</p>

  <p>All it will take is Storytellers and Lovers of Science and Knowledge,</p>
  <p>and Narrators, reading it all in the many languages.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>May this century,</p>
  <p>become The Century Of The School.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A tiny Audio Player, perhaps a solar powered School on a Chip,</p>
  <p>or free access satellites that truly bring the internet to all.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>We don&apos;t have to Love All Humanity at first,</p>
  <p>just the Tigers, the Big Pussy Cats, 3,890 left,</p>
  <p>let us come together now, let us help Earth and all of her inhabitants.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And where education leads,</p>
  <p>the nations will follow.</p>
