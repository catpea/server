  <p>Each day always starts with getting up,</p>
  <p>except that, in the little wilderness you can&apos;t just roll out of bed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>At first, at best, you roll over,</p>
  <p>to see where everything is at.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And although you can kind of lift yourself,</p>
  <p>you can&apos;t really get up.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You sleep on the ground,</p>
  <p>in a little tent.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>That means you can,</p>
  <p>only! stretch one limb at a time, and only a bit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A successful decoupling and release,</p>
  <p>requires great gymnastics.</p>
</div>

  <p>The first order of the day,</p>
  <p>is always fire, and a food item if you got one.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The trick to starting a fire,</p>
  <p>is to start with tiny twigs that matches can light.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And then you add bigger, and bigger sticks,</p>
  <p>it is absolutely required that you do a little dance.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The second order of the day, is adventure,</p>
  <p>so you set off immediately.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Bring a day pack a water bottle,</p>
  <p>if you are not sure where you are headed, follow the seagulls.</p>

  <p>In my case there is this <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/W5kMcSEMvZp3hEK56">fantastic out of place bench</a>,</p>
  <p>right a top a dune.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>One of the odd things about it is that,</p>
  <p>it is about a foot too high off the ground, due to dune erosion.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>To get atop of it, you must hoist a knee, and then kind of desperately roll in to it,</p>
  <p>with an intense expression, and you realize that you haven&apos;t done that since your terrible twos.</p>

  <p>Upon basking in the sun, the next order in the day,</p>
  <p>is troublemaking.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>On that particular day, I&apos;ve noticed two weary travelers by the parking lot,</p>
  <p>sniffing the leaves of a tree, that they were eagerly attempting to identify.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I briskly walked up to them and said,</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh my god, you guys, this is poison ivy, don&apos;t touch that.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>One of the older ladies started making chicken noises at her friend,</p>
  <p>and I waddled away.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>To, my surprise, I discovered that this parking lot held <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/JprRPGEXuuMNXfqn8">a water pump</a>,</p>
  <p>I had no idea.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The fourth order of the day,</p>
  <p>is the venerable search for a walking stick to continue the walk about.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>This is no easy mater at Nordhouse as you can&apos;t miss the:</p>
  <p>&quot;THIS IS BEAR COUNTY&quot; posters printed in Bold Comic Sans all over.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Any venture into the woods could potentially result in a dangerous standoff,</p>
  <p>between a snarling man and a beast.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The fifth order of the day, at least for me,</p>
  <p>is fossil hunting.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I have my collection right next to me as I write this,</p>
  <p>though they all look like gibberish to me, some of those thing are prehistoric.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Fantastic!</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is a long walk to my <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Sz1h1MygrHzHiXZq8">favorite spot</a>,</p>
  <p>but it looks like a dune valley where you are surrounded by pretty tall dunes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And here I cheerfully waddle back,</p>
  <p>with a pocket full of rocks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Back to my camp,</p>
  <p>eyes still searching for fossils.</p>

  <p>In the early afternoon it is good time to set off for the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/6DHxRYzUvH8Fdgn3A">gas station</a>,</p>
  <p>here I usually grab a sausage and a couple of gallons of water, maybe a candy bar.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And the day slowly nears getting some more firewood,</p>
  <p>sharpening a stick for the sausage, and waiting for the sunset to come.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>At Twilight I prepare my Audio Book for the evening,</p>
  <p>and crawl back into my fluffy sleeping bag.</p>
