  <p>No matter how many times a teacher punishes you with bad grades,</p>
  <p>you are most likely to assume you are not smart.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>The truth is that the teacher is a fraud,</p>
  <p>they are only preparing you to put on a show.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>The idea of subject divisions, pre-set time periods, and sitting in rows,</p>
  <p>is a horrible insult to you, there is no way to apologize for something like this.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>Personally, I suspect that organizations cannot help but to enter a run-away state,</p>
  <p>where all the participants brainlessly, heartlessly, and unwisely copy things in their incompetence.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>It appears that middle school and high school,</p>
  <p>are basically copies of elementary.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>Elementary does work,</p>
  <p>because it is very useful to memorize letters and numbers and words.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>But everything that comes after elementary is just elementary with extras,</p>
  <p>which cannot work.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>The expansion to include more subjects, and subject divisions,</p>
  <p>and introduce abstract ideas is devastating and can only force students to memorize.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>Formulas and abstract ideas are not mean to be memorized,</p>
  <p>they are meant to be disassembled, rebuilt.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>What is gained from this is meant to be used by subtle analogy</p>
  <p>to construct and re-construct new things.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>To memorize a formula,</p>
  <p>is to throw it away.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">

</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>In order for a school to try to function in some way,</p>
  <p>the dangerous standardized memorization and standardized testing, has emerged.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>You see the simplicity and desperation of it,</p>
  <p>of course.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>Get everyone to temporarily recall the same thing,</p>
  <p>and use the same test for evaluation.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>Tests that rely on previous knowledge,</p>
  <p>are simply re-memorized.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>A refresher course is not something that refreshes your memory,</p>
  <p>it is just an introduction to what is basically memorization for a new test.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">

</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>Modern education is very much like a dangerous theatrical play,</p>
  <p>everyone memorizes their part, puts on a show, and moves on to the next gig without learning anything.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>Because nobody is learning for real,</p>
  <p>and nobody is fully inheriting the wisdom gained in previous generations.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>People assemble in desperate self reinforcing cults,</p>
  <p>that can only repeat history&apos;s mistakes.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>Because of lack of wisdom,</p>
  <p>people are misleading themselves.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>And their chosen communities,</p>
  <p>can only further reinforce their mistaken beliefs.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">

<div class="section">
  <p>This is an old tragedy,</p>
  <p>prevention of this curse of blindness is a large part of the reason why mandatory schooling was invented.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>To prevent blindness, to prevent repetition of mistakes,</p>
  <p>to encourage, to inspire, to enable students with tools with which they can invent new things.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>But in blindness that is affecting multiple generations,</p>
  <p>it is cheaper, and easier to put on a sick show and sell the students out for small paycheck.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>Can large institutions on whom countless many people rely on for a desperate paycheck,</p>
  <p>server both the teachers and the students?</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>No, not really, not without Universal basic Income,</p>
  <p>not without generations of life long personalized (not standardized) education.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>Schools will eventually work,</p>
  <p>but it will take us a very long time to make this happen - a very long time.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>Even a university education is more about the diploma than the actual knowledge,</p>
  <p>it is not how knowledgeable a person is, it is the name of the university on the diploma that matters.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">

</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>It is important for me to share these ideas with you,</p>
  <p>precisely because so many of us have been tricked into thinking we are not smart.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>Too many got crushed by the gears of the runaway machinery that sells a fantasy of education,</p>
  <p>and sends a teacher back home with a paycheck, that they didn&apos;t deserve.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <hr>

<div class="section">
  <p>You are just as smart as everyone else,</p>
  <p>including the confusing university graduates that fill blackboards with strange mathematical notations.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>The reason why they are able to manipulate mathematical notation,</p>
  <p>is that they taught themselves <a href="https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code">what it actually does</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>Search the internet for <a href="https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code">Math As Code</a> to see that notation expressed in a more modern approachable way,</p>
  <p>math nerds just took the time to take formulas apart and gained the ability to reassemble them from scratch.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>This doers not mean that they are smarter than you,</p>
  <p>but they have a larger collection of tools and visualizations.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>They don&apos;t quite memorize things,</p>
  <p>they retain them the way you retained how to use your cell phone, or start your car remotely, or how to replace the toner in your printer.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>They don&apos;t force them selves to repeat over and over, countlesly repeating the same task,</p>
  <p>they just find it useful, even exiting, they see it as something that they will later rely on in real life, they see it as a need, and a strength.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>We are each very unique, and one person may see themselves in an observatory at night,</p>
  <p>scribbling extremely exciting back-of-the-envelope calculations, and maybe circuits to modernize some hardware.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>There is something in their life that led them to the stars,</p>
  <p>a book, a parent, a movie, or maybe even a school trip.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>If you don&apos;t have that and the experiences leading up to it,</p>
  <p>stars won&apos;t interest you, the observatory will not call to your heart, and you will not be interested in understanding mathematics.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>But without a doubt, there are experiences in you that have conspired to create an interest,</p>
  <p>it feels like it has always been there and it has always been a little friend.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>If you follow it, if you follow what moves you, then everything on the path leading up to it, will stick to you, it will feel great to learn new things,</p>
  <p>it will make you feel satisfaction, and a kind of quiet joy, and fiddling with all the little bits you learned will feel like meditation.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>But it has to be something that is calling to you, that has been within you for a very long time,</p>
  <p>and if you are still young then it is something that a series of you most amazing adventures is already pointing towards.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>If someone else tells yo to become a Doctor or a Lawyer something that you are not interested in, then your mind will reject everything that will follow,</p>
  <p>when you choose the path that brings you relief and joy the road ahead of you won&apos;t be so much about learning, but merely advancing forward, towards something that you like.</p>

  <p>Please, accept the responsibility for your own education,</p>
  <p>and never again trust anyone with it.</p>
