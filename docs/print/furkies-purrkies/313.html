    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No matter how many times a teacher punishes you with bad grades,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you are most likely to assume you are not smart.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The truth is that the teacher is a fraud,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they are only preparing you to put on a show.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The idea of subject divisions, pre-set time periods, and sitting in rows,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is a horrible insult to you, there is no way to apologize for something like this.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Personally, I suspect that organizations cannot help but to enter a run-away state,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">where all the participants brainlessly, heartlessly, and unwisely copy things in their incompetence.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It appears that middle school and high school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are basically copies of elementary.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Elementary does work,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because it is very useful to memorize letters and numbers and words.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But everything that comes after elementary is just elementary with extras,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">which cannot work.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The expansion to include more subjects, and subject divisions,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and introduce abstract ideas is devastating and can only force students to memorize.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Formulas and abstract ideas are not mean to be memorized,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they are meant to be disassembled, rebuilt.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What is gained from this is meant to be used by subtle analogy</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to construct and re-construct new things.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To memorize a formula,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is to throw it away.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In order for a school to try to function in some way,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the dangerous standardized memorization and standardized testing, has emerged.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You see the simplicity and desperation of it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">of course.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Get everyone to temporarily recall the same thing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and use the same test for evaluation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Tests that rely on previous knowledge,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are simply re-memorized.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A refresher course is not something that refreshes your memory,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is just an introduction to what is basically memorization for a new test.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Modern education is very much like a dangerous theatrical play,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">everyone memorizes their part, puts on a show, and moves on to the next gig without learning anything.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Because nobody is learning for real,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and nobody is fully inheriting the wisdom gained in previous generations.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">People assemble in desperate self reinforcing cults,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that can only repeat history's mistakes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Because of lack of wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">people are misleading themselves.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And their chosen communities,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">can only further reinforce their mistaken beliefs.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is an old tragedy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">prevention of this curse of blindness is a large part of the reason why mandatory schooling was invented.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To prevent blindness, to prevent repetition of mistakes,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to encourage, to inspire, to enable students with tools with which they can invent new things.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But in blindness that is affecting multiple generations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is cheaper, and easier to put on a sick show and sell the students out for small paycheck.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Can large institutions on whom countless many people rely on for a desperate paycheck,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">server both the teachers and the students?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No, not really, not without Universal basic Income,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">not without generations of life long personalized (not standardized) education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Schools will eventually work,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but it will take us a very long time to make this happen - a very long time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even a university education is more about the diploma than the actual knowledge,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is not how knowledgeable a person is, it is the name of the university on the diploma that matters.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is important for me to share these ideas with you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">precisely because so many of us have been tricked into thinking we are not smart.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Too many got crushed by the gears of the runaway machinery that sells a fantasy of education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and sends a teacher back home with a paycheck, that they didn't deserve.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are just as smart as everyone else,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">including the confusing university graduates that fill blackboards with strange mathematical notations.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The reason why they are able to manipulate mathematical notation,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is that they taught themselves <span>what it actually does<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Search the internet for <span>Math As Code<sup>[2]</sup></span> to see that notation expressed in a more modern approachable way,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">math nerds just took the time to take formulas apart and gained the ability to reassemble them from scratch.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This doers not mean that they are smarter than you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but they have a larger collection of tools and visualizations.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They don't quite memorize things,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they retain them the way you retained how to use your cell phone, or start your car remotely, or how to replace the toner in your printer.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They don't force them selves to repeat over and over, countlesly repeating the same task,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they just find it useful, even exiting, they see it as something that they will later rely on in real life, they see it as a need, and a strength.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are each very unique, and one person may see themselves in an observatory at night,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">scribbling extremely exciting back-of-the-envelope calculations, and maybe circuits to modernize some hardware.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is something in their life that led them to the stars,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a book, a parent, a movie, or maybe even a school trip.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you don't have that and the experiences leading up to it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">stars won't interest you, the observatory will not call to your heart, and you will not be interested in understanding mathematics.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But without a doubt, there are experiences in you that have conspired to create an interest,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it feels like it has always been there and it has always been a little friend.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you follow it, if you follow what moves you, then everything on the path leading up to it, will stick to you, it will feel great to learn new things,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it will make you feel satisfaction, and a kind of quiet joy, and fiddling with all the little bits you learned will feel like meditation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But it has to be something that is calling to you, that has been within you for a very long time,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and if you are still young then it is something that a series of you most amazing adventures is already pointing towards.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If someone else tells yo to become a Doctor or a Lawyer something that you are not interested in, then your mind will reject everything that will follow,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when you choose the path that brings you relief and joy the road ahead of you won't be so much about learning, but merely advancing forward, towards something that you like.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Please, accept the responsibility for your own education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and never again trust anyone with it.</div>
