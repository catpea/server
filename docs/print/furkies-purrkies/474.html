  <div class="paragraph">Do you understand how important you are, without you the world is unable to progress forward,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when the liars have masses they can manipulate, they gain the power to hold the world back.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is true that superhero stories are just a projection of what we are capable of,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but the same goes for the dark side, they will sway the uneducated to get them to vote on laws that hurt the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Voters are only as capable as the culture they grow up in, that is why free speech and freedom of thought is important,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it sets those who are about to corner themselves free to grow and flourish.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">All that can be said about where you need to learn from, is that we will fight to keep libraries open,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and we will separate fantasy from reality, and all the life changing are available for free in a narrated format.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You don't have to go to the library, but you must find your way to books, to narrated books, to biographies, and storytellers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">lives lived for real, wisdom won in great battles, and the defeat of great manipulators, dictators, and liars.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">School can only teach you to memorize, that is only good for numbers and letters, and can't translate well beyond the basics,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>you need to learn when you are ready to learn<sup>[1]</sup></span>, <span>learn at your own pace<sup>[2]</sup></span>, <span>and in a sequence that fits what you already know<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
