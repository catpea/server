    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">To End World Poverty</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Forgive me, Dear Reader, as this poem does not yet end with an answer,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but it does create a question that brings us one step closer to it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">President Kennedy once said,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"Too many of us think it is impossible too many think it is unreal but that is a dangerous defeatist belief</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it leads to the conclusion that war is inevitable that mankind is doomed that we are gripped by forces we cannot control</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we need not accept that view our problems are man-made therefore they can be solved by man and man can be as big as he wants</div>
  <div class="paragraph">no problem of human destiny is beyond human beings</div>
  <div class="paragraph">man's reason and spirit have often solved the seemingly unsolvable and we believe they can do it again".</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The world misunderstood money,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and it has begun relying on its simplest and most primitive mechanics.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Who knows why, but we can see that those who are in the know,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for example business people on Wall Street, use it differently from the rest of us.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Well, the rest of us can build complex streets as well,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we can erect infrastructure that will help US use it differently.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are Eight Billion strong,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the wrong doers are nothing by contrast.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Poverty can only be erased by those who are its victims,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">world governments are too primitive to do anything about it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The human mind is powerful and beautiful,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and all human beings deserve safety, food, and a home, not just shelter, but a home.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In order to build an infrastructure that can bring money to the poor,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we will have to use technology - computer tablets can be as inexpensive as $35.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A tablet connected to the global internet,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is far more powerful than shorting stocks and predicting or manipulating markets.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have to start with a person who was given a plastic chair,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">at a local homeless shelter.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They have the option of work assistance,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or having their chair taken away.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And we have to start with prisons, a long sentence,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">nothing to coma back to but more broken promises, and more poverty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Prison takes away the Hope in Humanity,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the way the so called smart people treat the criminals destroys our entire world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And here, we give a person,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">access to a tablet.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Obviously the first and foremost,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are the narrated books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No matter how dark the future,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the narrated books, bring the light.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They help sleep at night,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they bring knowledge and experience.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And they are beautiful, private,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">sacred and full of wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Here great many voice actors and celebrities,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will MAKE time to lend their voice to books in the Public Domain.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">While the books will heal the mind, and bring wisdom, and calm,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as well as the understanding that being born poor to a violent neighborhood victimizes a person into someone other than they really are; in other words self-forgiveness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Here the least fortunate of The Human Family,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">still need a way out of poverty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There needs to be a program on the tablet,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that will both protect the assets they create, and help them create more.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For many that tablet will represent the work of a lifetime,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the full measure, of the hope, in their new and better future.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Whatever happens on that tablet,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">must be safe from fellow inmates, prison employees, and crooked politicians and presidents.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We can all be sure,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that things that do represent monetary value, require study; and the more one learns the easier it gets.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The simplest and safest asset a person under attack can keep,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is knowledge learned.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For example, if the tablet was to teach how to write computer programs,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">how to design user interfaces, efficient web servers, secure networks.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That person would be able to leave their past behind,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and build a company, perhaps with colleagues from the same environment.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is not the same as going to school, or even going to business school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this the study and assembly of a ready to go development house.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The tablet would contain a simulated, ready to go business,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with real case studies, and projects.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In a safer environment, where it is possible to open a bank account,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">where one can be reasonably sure that what lite money they have will not be taken away.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A planet wide market,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">where people create digital goods.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A program architecture that relies on the human mind,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">where a person is answering simple questions to build a unique and greater whole that will help them out of poverty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And while this would be too cumbersome for one individual,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it would be doable for a network of thousands, or perhaps billions of people fighting their way out of poverty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Where prison offers time to practice,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the world of the streets requires an instant trickle of money.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And this income must absolutely require,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the best and most creative that the human mind can produce.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This way world's Corrupt Politicians will not be able to force the homeless to slave for them,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it has to be more meaningful work than training neural networks.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We can convert prisons to Start-up Accelerators,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that will emerge companies ready to accept clients.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But helping people who don't have a roof over their head,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">who don't have rations waiting for them, must include instant money.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is not just a man on a plastic chair,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is also the woman who has nowhere left to go.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What is on the tablet that helps her pay for the apartment,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and it isn't just random noise, but something meaningful, that adds up to create a greater whole.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Because if we can help those two,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">go to pay rent, and buy a house, and a car and then make it a home.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Then we will have ended poverty,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">not just for those two, but for the world over.</div>
