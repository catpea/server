      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">So, What Is Learning Anyway?</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us define some things up front:</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Teaching, or being taught, is when someone else is trying to make you learn.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Learning, is when you your self reach out for knowledge.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Studying, means looking at something up close.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Studying for an exam, is code for memorization.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Memorization in context of standardized education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is gaining a temporary ability to mindlessly recall some facts for a matching test.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Before I learned English I memorized the opening speech in Star Trek TNG,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the theme song to Cheers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The way I did this was to write down the sounds I heard in the speech,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in my own native language like this:</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"Dis ar de vojadzes ov startrek enterprys",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I knew what the speech was about, but I wasn't able to match up the words quite yet.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">At 16 or so, I wouldn't know how to write it down,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in away that I could get it right.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What ultimately helped me learn English was cartoons and closed captions,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and above all moving to America, I had a reason, I had a want, I had a passion for English.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The only thing that didn't help me learn English was Shakespeare,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">which I tried to read because everyone said it was English.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Though I struggled with the <span>Balcony Scene<sup>[1]</sup></span> in Romeo and Juliet,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I also fell in love with it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I memorized a lot of quotes from the back of the book,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they just roll of my tongue to this day.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Learning, requires that you have a need to learn something,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Memorizing, has nothing to do with learning, it is all about acting.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Yes, I am able to recite the speech from Star Trek in real English,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">even though I learned it as babble and gibberish, but that is the most horrible way to learn to recite something from memory, it is a joke.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To learn something, means to have enough connecting fiber to know it without mnemonics or tricks,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to learn something requires the involvement of a kind of love.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A good example of that kind of love is coming to country that you always wanted to live in,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and absorbing things, you don't memorize, memorization is thin, hollow, temporary, easily damaged or warped.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I never sat down to memorize English words,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I just had this massive overwhelming urge to understand what the <span>Ninja Turtles<sup>[2]</sup></span> were talking about.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I wanted to be in on their jokes, once I learned to separate what I was hearing into words,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">which is just a function of becoming familiar with the language.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I found the words most frequently used were indicative of structure,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the meaning was found in the context.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Context is something you get out of what has been happening in the cartoon,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">where you think the cartoon is going, where it usually goes, what characters usually do, and what you understood thus far.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I only recently learned that the opening intro says "heroes in a half shell",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I always heard it as "hap shell" (H.A.P.) and because I wasn't used to hearing that elsewhere, I assumed the word is just mangled.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(I was familiar with word half and shell back when watching the cartoons, but I still think half shell is a pretty odd way of describing something dome shaped.)</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It was a big deal for me to find something from Ninja Turtles,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in <span>Inspector Gadget<sup>[3]</sup></span>, and <span>The DJ Kat Show<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For those of you who think it is crazy or silly to learn from cartoons,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">take a look at one of the better alternatives: <span>Follow Me - Beginner, Part 1<sup>[5]</sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I won't mention text books here,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as they aren't useful at all, six months of closed captions is all it takes to get to story books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To end this note, I wanted to mention Audio Books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">at a certain point, sooner than later, books like Top 100 Poems, and anything by Bill Bryson, take care of the rest.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So as long as the person is learning at their own pace everything will work out,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but to force someone to learn faster, is very cruel, and may put an end to that person's delicate curiosities.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Making them feel stupid for learning at their own pace by grading them down,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will probably cause great and long lasting harm to their self esteem and interests.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Forcing children to learn within time constraints,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and punishing them for failure, will only force them into temporary memorization as a way of protecting themselves.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Unethical schools will exploit that to their advantage,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they will keep the kids stressed out and purposefully force them into meaningless memorization so that everyone gets paid.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is a concept of a <span>Elaborative Rehearsal<sup>[6]</sup></span> that somewhat shines some light on this cruelty,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when contrasted with the notion of a Maintenance Rehearsal.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But even Elaborative Rehearsal does not come close what it means to Actually Really Learn,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a person can only learn or as we should call it soak up, inhale, integrate new knowledge, when they are moving along a path that is of great interest to them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That means, people can only really learn what they are interested in,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and will not learn if they are taught in segments by teachers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is difficult to believe that <span>schools do not work<sup>[7]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it maybe impossible for many to believe they are an insult to the younger generations.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To make headway in this discussion, we must resist speaking in the bare abstract terms,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we must only speak in terms of specific subjects (like Math), or areas like (Science), and focus on reproducible results.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A child that learns mathematics for real will end up creating computer game engines,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">visualization frameworks, computer games, generative graphics, and even generative music.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A child that is taught mathematics, will only learn to recall few of the most popular formulas,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">later on in life, in a discussion about learning math, they will be ashamed of having only memorized formulas (in the goodness of their hearts they will still not blame schools).</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This interest in making formulas come to life, with computers can be short lived,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in which case the person is likely to take to electronics, <span>programming machines to take their art outside<sup>[8]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Mathematics as it is taught in school, will be disabling to most students,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the result of that is they they will not look into programming, they won't want to take their art outside, and a whole world will be denied to them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The <span>math taught in school is cutting people off from a whole world of sweet curiosities<sup>[9]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this has been going on for so long, that we can only be speechless...</div>
