  <p>Learning is one of the most important things we do, we need it for our health.</p>
  <p>Learning helps us rise above our limits, and it sets us free from misperceptions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Learning requires that we progress in layers, that we build upon our existing knowledge.</p>
  <p>We can only grow more knowledgeable when we build a comfortable little road of delicate achievements.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Learning requires happy curiosity, enjoyment, satisfaction, and distant horizons.</p>
  <p>The best kind of education is beautiful, colorful, enriching, and joyful.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Calm, joy, happiness and Love of Life, is the is the secret of genius.</p>
  <p>Happily sitting down beneath an apple tree, to review one&apos;s journals, and every once in a while hear an apple fall.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We have to be very careful to avoid toxic environments that push us into hoop jumping, or worse yet cause fractures and breed distrust towards education.</p>
  <p>In schools of today, we can only really memorize, jump the hoops and follow their rules. That&apos;s not Education, that&apos;s more like role play.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Education is too important to play games with.</p>
  <p>Spending years pretending to get educated, is only going to earn your teacher money and grant you debt.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You will get older and poorer, and make your make-believe-teachers look more legitimate.</p>
  <p>Just say no; choose Authenticity and Self Education, at your own happy pace with the books you love and teachers you admire.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Learn on your own, listen to Audio Books and Lectures, choose happiness.</p>
  <p>Learning is sacred, choose adventure, choose genius.</p>
