      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Fake Schools, Fake Education And How To Spot A Creepy Cult Of Greed</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let me start by giving you the answer first:</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>FOLLOW THE MONEY<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now, before I get into explanations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I must first give you an example of a Real School, and an Example of a Fake One.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Y Combinator is a [kind of a] Real School<sup>[2]</sup></span> even though it has been built as a Start-up Accelerator,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I write this in the year 2021, and at the moment it is as perfect of an example as one could possibly ask for, though it will evolve towards it original goal and not a replacement school.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is the best example today,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it just goes to show how far today's schools have misunderstood their purpose.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It not only teaches and inspires,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but also helps their students by giving them money for a reasonable cut of their future profits, all the while respecting their creativity and independence.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">While I think highly of Y Combinator,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">my advice is not to merely participate in it, but to learn how to build one that is more focused on personalized education, lets call it School 2.0.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now, a Fake School, is anything that <span>takes money from a student, or their parents<sup>[3]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if you are paying for it, then you are being cheated, you are being cheated by a fake school.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If they really believed they could teach you, then they would take a small cut of your future profits,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">like Y Combinator does, but since they don't believe in you, you have to pay up-front with loans that will not be forgiven for any reason.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Again, we must put an end to this charade, and begin creating institutions that actually enable their students financially,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">rather than disabling them, merely to add to some hedge fund or bottomless endowment.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Don't worry too much, when liars take hold, it takes very little to out-compete them, and repair the situation entirely,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but you do have to begin opening your eyes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Get ready to build a personalized education University, with a focus on financial independence,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and a lifelong personalized curriculum that begins with an idea the student is passionate about, and results in a small company in under a year.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In terms of transitioning to a more authentic educational system, the sooner you start building, the more perks you will inherit,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">tax exempt status and subsidy is a good example, but do remember that to eliminate the corruption of education these perks must be shut down as soon as possible.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Today, If all you can do, is pay for a school that gives you the career path that you are interested in,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then I am sorry to say, your career path is still trapped in Dark Ages, by greed, shortsightedness, lies, corruption and charades.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A school that takes money upfront has a conflict of interest that defeats the purpose of its existence, and permanently stains its name,</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>they will slowly teach less and charge more, while putting on a less mediocre show<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just like we may never forgive schools for participating in slavery,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we must never forgive schools for participating in systems of corruption that sell a student's mind for a small profit.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do not be surprised that all paid schools aim to sell a fantasy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">after all paid schools are not the only tax-exempt institutions that sell falsehoods.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have a long history of accepting institutions without question or objection,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is our greatest flaw of character, it creates heartbreaking and mind bending anomalies.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But we have progressed,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">haven't we?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A prestigious school can only pretend so as long as its students don't ask too many questions and choose to remain blind,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">eventually an Open Curriculum will lead to the undoing of said false schools.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And networking be damned,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Humanity is more important than the University.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And if that is still false for some graduates,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then that certainly indicates gushing-flattery will smitten them into out-of-network collaboration.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have progressed,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">more powerful than our biggest flaw, is our <span>disdain for inauthenticity and fat endowments<sup>[5]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Again, I ask you to stay of good cheer,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">though today it many not be possible for you to become a Doctor as Untarnished and Proud as you deserve to be.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The position of a Dean, of the first Honest University, one providing Personalized Education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and only taking a fair and unobtrusive percentage of graduate profits, is now open to you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Paving the way for your first Valedictorian to walk the career path that you once hoped existed for you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and now exists because of you - is just as noble as the noblest of your dreams, today.</div>
