  <div class="paragraph">We are each a miracle of Cosmos,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and each day is a gift.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Life is not short, life is so long,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that you are going to forget a bunch a stuff, and not care.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But it is possible to run in circles;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">pretend to learn, work hard at a job you hate, and never really grow up.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is easy to avoid this,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we just need to listen to some deeply fascinating and inspiring audio books on a long, beautiful and healthy adventure.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But also, we can't really return from the adventure,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we have to continue climbing at the same of better angle that the adventure pushed us into.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That is what growing is,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we never go back to little things, we always go forward to the greater things.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For example, the moment I help yo understand that school is robbing you of creativity,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that cramming and memorizing is just acting and not learning, you have to aim higher, and learn for real.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You can go back to school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but you can only treat it as a game.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Know that you are not getting an education, and the curricula are going to be all over the place, and you'll just spin in circles merely exercising your temporary memory,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you are unlikely to be inheriting knowledge and components of wisdom from great beings, onward to becoming wise, and eventually speaking out as a Great Being.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">School is not going to teach you that,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you will still need a real education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And although life is very long,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is still worrisome that someone should sink several years towards an unknown, a goal set in childhood.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Charles Bukowski, who does not mince words, asks this terrible question,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">about the morning routine - and I quote:</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"How in the hell could a man enjoy being awakened at 8:30 a.m. by an alarm clock,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">leap out of bed, dress, force-feed, s*it, p*ss, brush teeth and hair,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and fight traffic to get to a place where essentially you made lots of money for somebody else and were asked to be grateful for the opportunity to do so?"</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Furthermore, Henry Thoreau, or Socrates reminds us,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that we need to know what life is, and the following quote is from Walden.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to front only the essential facts of life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to cut a broad swath and shave close,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms..."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">These are great beings, they are immortal, full of wisdom and knowledge,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is really important to - if not befriend them - then to at least answer their questions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Like I said, life is so long that you are going to forget a bunch of years,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and not even feel bad about it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But lowering ourselves into a decades long routine,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that we may kind of regret later on, is not good.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">While life is long,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we don't get a do over, so we have to make sure that we are headed towards a good and healthy future, an authentic future.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All I am saying, is that you must carefully examine life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because there are too many people out there that will try to take advantage of your inexperience.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">By examining life, by listening to great beings with large libraries of experiences, mistakes, failures and triumphs,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you will learn from their life, and get a really good idea of where you really want to be.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And more than that,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you can take multiple paths.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For example become a writer and a poet, first; and then go back to Med School after you crossed the Appalachian Trail a couple of times,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and after you fought some Angry Bears and Mountain Lions with little more than Courage and some sharp Nail Clippers.</div>
