  <p>We are each a miracle of Cosmos,</p>
  <p>and each day is a gift.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Life is not short, life is so long,</p>
  <p>that you are going to forget a bunch a stuff, and not care.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But it is possible to run in circles;</p>
  <p>pretend to learn, work hard at a job you hate, and never really grow up.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is easy to avoid this,</p>
  <p>we just need to listen to some deeply fascinating and inspiring audio books on a long, beautiful and healthy adventure.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But also, we can&apos;t really return from the adventure,</p>
  <p>we have to continue climbing at the same of better angle that the adventure pushed us into.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>That is what growing is,</p>
  <p>we never go back to little things, we always go forward to the greater things.</p>

  <p>For example, the moment I help yo understand that school is robbing you of creativity,</p>
  <p>that cramming and memorizing is just acting and not learning, you have to aim higher, and learn for real.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You can go back to school,</p>
  <p>but you can only treat it as a game.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Know that you are not getting an education, and the curricula are going to be all over the place, and you&apos;ll just spin in circles merely exercising your temporary memory,</p>
  <p>you are unlikely to be inheriting knowledge and components of wisdom from great beings, onward to becoming wise, and eventually speaking out as a Great Being.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>School is not going to teach you that,</p>
  <p>you will still need a real education.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And although life is very long,</p>
  <p>it is still worrisome that someone should sink several years towards an unknown, a goal set in childhood.</p>

  <p>Charles Bukowski, who does not mince words, asks this terrible question,</p>
  <p>about the morning routine - and I quote:</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>&quot;How in the hell could a man enjoy being awakened at 8:30 a.m. by an alarm clock,</p>
  <p>leap out of bed, dress, force-feed, s*it, p*ss, brush teeth and hair,</p>
  <p>and fight traffic to get to a place where essentially you made lots of money for somebody else and were asked to be grateful for the opportunity to do so?&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Furthermore, Henry Thoreau, or Socrates reminds us,</p>
  <p>that we need to know what life is, and the following quote is from Walden.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>&quot;I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately,</p>
  <p>to front only the essential facts of life,</p>
  <p>and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear;</p>
  <p>nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life,</p>
  <p>to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life,</p>
  <p>to cut a broad swath and shave close,</p>
  <p>to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms...&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

<div class="section">
  <p>These are great beings, they are immortal, full of wisdom and knowledge,</p>
  <p>it is really important to - if not befriend them - then to at least answer their questions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Like I said, life is so long that you are going to forget a bunch of years,</p>
  <p>and not even feel bad about it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But lowering ourselves into a decades long routine,</p>
  <p>that we may kind of regret later on, is not good.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>While life is long,</p>
  <p>we don&apos;t get a do over, so we have to make sure that we are headed towards a good and healthy future, an authentic future.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>All I am saying, is that you must carefully examine life,</p>
  <p>because there are too many people out there that will try to take advantage of your inexperience.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>By examining life, by listening to great beings with large libraries of experiences, mistakes, failures and triumphs,</p>
  <p>you will learn from their life, and get a really good idea of where you really want to be.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And more than that,</p>
  <p>you can take multiple paths.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>For example become a writer and a poet, first; and then go back to Med School after you crossed the Appalachian Trail a couple of times,</p>
  <p>and after you fought some Angry Bears and Mountain Lions with little more than Courage and some sharp Nail Clippers.</p>
