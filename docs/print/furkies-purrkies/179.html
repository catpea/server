  <p>It rained today, but was also my jogging day,</p>
  <p>so went about it in a warrior&apos;s way.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I looked out the window and it was entirely too dark,</p>
  <p>I said, &quot;I hope I wont have to hide under a tree in some park.&quot;</p>

  <p>As I made it to Ford Road it didn&apos;t seem that bad,</p>
  <p>and then I felt the first three drops hit my head.</p>

  <p>I decided to keep going as a proper health nut should,</p>
  <p>and a quarter way through, I got soaked pretty good.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Just when I thought the clouds parted,</p>
  <p>there was a grumble and the rain really started.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It rained heavy, but it didn&apos;t last very long,</p>
  <p>I ran cheerfully feeling Mighty and Strong.</p>

  <p>My biggest problem were the geese,</p>
  <p>where I come from it is a fierce creature that knows no peace.</p>

  <p>When I was a child they chased me and would often hiss,</p>
  <p>but the ones by the Mall seem to be loving and full of bliss.</p>

  <p>I was a beautiful day, without a doubt,</p>
  <p>and, as the afternoon unfolded the sun came out.</p>
