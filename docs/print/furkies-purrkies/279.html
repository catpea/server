    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All that has ever gone wrong,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">has gone wrong due to rejecting realities, and accepting, fantasies.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To deny truth, is to create a terrible fantasy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and no human being should ever be committed to one - as life is far too precious.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Yes, fantasies in a sickly way are more comfortable,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">than the authentic life that unfolds by rules independent from our wishes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But rejecting pleasant fantasies is no different</div>
  <div class="paragraph">than the rejection of drugs.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is simply not who we are,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and not where healthy people wish to be, or can possibly grow.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is not that the world is too difficult to grasp,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but that, too many people are suffering from lack of knowledge.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Knowledge is found in books, best experience in their audio form,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and on a pleasant and relaxing adventure.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Books whose authors are admired for their hard work, clarity of long therm vision,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">intelligence, wisdom, and often a wonderful sense of humor.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Alas, far too many people take to relive their fears by,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by constructing a view of the world they can understand and control.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All fantasies will eventually call for reinforcement,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and as history shows, at any, and all cost.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Be it something as tiny as the number of likes on a social network,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as odd as the status that pointlessly-expensive-cars bring.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Or something as heartbreaking as political systems,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">where fathers will easily send their children to kill each other in battle fields.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A fantasy will call for reinforcement,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to keep it going to make it last, and no price will ever be too big.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Reality, is much harsher and not as comfortable or easy to grasp,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will call for constant effort, hard earned foresight, real and lasting results to our endeavors, and authentic dignity.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In reality; color of skin, numbered of colored pieces of paper, or the colors of a flag,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">do not define who is superior, and who is inferior, who is better and who is worse.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In fantasy, poverty and war, are facts of life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in reality, Love, Health, and World Peace, are, the most beautiful rewards for the most difficult of achievements.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In fantasy we crated tens of thousands of gods and as many battles in their worship,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in reality we invent Flight, try to get to the Moon for no clear reason, and even fantasize about Interstellar Travel to cross the galaxy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In reality there is no evil, just a steady and colorful progress forward, we build Nuclear Plants and not Nuclear Missiles,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in fantasy evil oozes from the cracks that mad men must keep patching to prevent their small minds from falling to a thousand pieces.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Fantasies spread with culture,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they quite imperceptibly trick us into thinking of ourselves as other than we really are.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For example, if you don't believe you can be a genius,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you will not be able to become one, you'll never aim for it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The longer you delay, the more obstacles will arise in your path</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if you don't believe you can cross that challenge, you won't even try.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you grant others control over your time, or life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you will only limit yourself and how far you can travel.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your mind is powerful enough to host cities of thoughts and dreams of, any size,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the only limit to your intelligence is the ability to mistakenly stop your self by accepting some falsehood.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Love, genius, empathy, foresight and insight, and spirituality exist within us all,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but without knowledge and eventual wisdom they too are limited and fall short.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Yes, at first, the real world is unknown to us,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but it is not meant to frighten us into creating fantasies that we think we can grasp.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It simply requires that we listen to a hundred books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">take a moment to explore the world around us with our new found experience...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And then very slowly and very gently as our long lives unfold,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">listen to, and read, just about nine hundred more as not to ever fall short, and always have a beautiful story to tell.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are sure to become wise, with all the building blocks we gain from books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and then, if should we wish, we can turn right around and create some new books for others to read, and grow up with.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do not be scared my friends,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as scary as poverty is, its power flows precisely from lack of education, wisdom and above all foresight.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The more knowledgeable and wiser the world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the more overwhelming the force to crush poverty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Growing up to become knowledgeable and wise as opposed to merely age in some easy fantasy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is critical for our mental health and well being.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A thousand books you can listen to while traveling worlds most beautiful hiking trails,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is hardly a challenge, it shouldn't even be seen as a inconvenience.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Inheriting real and functional knowledge, that has a powerful and lasting impact on our growing up,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that enriches and enhances our decision making bringing us clear visions and impossible dreams is a great reward.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Becoming broke, or homeless, never being able to get a job, and being seen as a waste of life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is not something that can happen to a wise a beautiful person that rejects fantasies in search of truths.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And it is important to remember,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that we can't graduate a by cramming and temporary memorizing disconnected facts.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A fake education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is a meaningless education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Companies known for hiring such inauthentic individuals are full of life draining liars and pretenders and probably in high positions,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">whatever they build cannot be built with vision and wisdom, it can only self destruct.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once you become self educated,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you are granted the opportunity to build your own companies with foresight and invention.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My dear reader, I would bet building an open and grade-free school that actually educates its students will be high up on your to-do list.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Building companies only becomes stressful when you build them for their own sake due to lack of vision,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when you enter on the path towards wisdom, you won't merely aim to impress investors, you will move generations.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is OK to blindly set off towards wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is one of the few leaps of faith that are worth the while.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Whatever your aims, may you inspire countless dreamers to greatness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and may you reject all fantasy, holding authenticity and wisdom as the highest of values.</div>
