    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The Simple Architecture Of Real Schools</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let me just open by hypothesizing <span>why schools are not teaching<sup>[1]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is because they don't actually know how, and <span>since everyone gets paid anyway, they see no reason to fix it<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us use, learning a photo editing program, as an example,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">today schools use multiple choice tests to asses the knowledge of a subject.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Instead of evaluating the students by for example asking them to create a fake photo,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">hide it among real photographs and let the class try to guess which is the fake one.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Schools use questions like, what is the purpose of image desaturation?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A) making it sharper, B) making it lighter, C) all of the above, D) we're pretending to teach to take a paycheck home.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I know that in a real image editing class, an actual program is used,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but the photo editing program we are using here, is an analogy for mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is meant to demonstrate fake lectures,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and matching ineffective tests, in serious subject.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But even in a real photo editing class, the teachers still end up failing the students,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because the real grade would have to be opening a successful photography business and making $100.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This could be signing up with Unsplash, and using the site to become a Droneographer or a wedding photographer,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">see, just learning how to use a photo editing program is useless.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The class must begin with photography, center around image editing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and passing all the students that now have a functional business.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Schools can't do this, because it would reveal them as ineffective,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so as long as we are OK, with them being already ineffective, we are wasting our time, and the time of all the children.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Oh and by the, your kid is not supposed work Fast Food, or Retail,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">those are not jobs for the children that represent the Future of Human Kind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Schools, actually could provide the students with 3 to 10 "side projects",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a side project is a miniature business, that makes about a $100 a month.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To return to our analogy for mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">these subjects are not being tested, the only thing that is tested here is the students ability to temporary memorize.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is fraud, math is actually quite testable,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but since schools are not teaching, all the children would fail math on a real test.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The math nerds, are not a vote for things working out sometimes,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they are self taught, they learn about math, math history, and the underlying concepts on their own, they learn for real.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The lectures are ineffective, the tests only test memorization and lying,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and all the class really teaches is how to cram before a test, which works great for a factory job as well.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Imagine a factory, that would give its employees surprise college entry exams,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">about every month on average - what would that reveal about the employees, would they all continue passing the surprise tests?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I would guess,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they would all fail with a low score.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That is because they only retain what they learned for a few days,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they aren't actually educated, they are memorizing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now, that I painted a certain picture for you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and let you make your own conclusions, lets fix this up.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Unfortunately I have to mention every step that led me to this architecture,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the first one is a little creepy, so lets just get it out of the way.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In 1985 Orson Scott Card introduced the idea of a game like intelligence test,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for Andrew "Ender" Wiggin, in his si-fi book Ender's Game.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When I read the book, I already suspected that creating a game like educational experience,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">could be useful in real education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">About a decade back, one of the science popularized released a game that dealt with space,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and currently there is an a game entitled <span>Kerbal Space Program<sup>[3]</sup></span> that teachers Orbital Dynamics, this is by a different publisher.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">About eight years ago I came across the concept of <span>Gamemification, making serious things game like<sup>[4]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">wikipedia describes it as:</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"Gamemification strategic attempt to enhance systems, services, organisations and activities,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in order to create similar experiences to those experienced when playing games,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in order to motivate and engage users."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us pause here for a moment, and note that Kerbal Space Program like game,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is a good example of a real test of knowledge of Mathematics, Physics, and Orbital Dynamics.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The student fails an Orbital Dynamics lecture, if they are unable to put a simulated shuttle in earths orbit,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this is a real test of real knowledge.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The precise scenario the student will be presented will be random, it could be the sun's orbit,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">geo stationary orbit, or get a ship nearing mars into the martian orbit.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There will be a series of tests and paid internships,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that ends in working for NASA or ESA, or some private company.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">These organizations have a say in the tests that they require,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the school will be influenced by industry seeking talent, and not politicians seeking re-elections.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The student will see employment statistics,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they will be able to make an informed decision about this particular job market.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Not everyone likes space things,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">space is a cold and dangerous place.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We all had music class at some point,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and many of us didn't realize that we could have a side job as a DJ, as a musician.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Music composition takes just a couple of days, if not hours,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when taught right.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The <span>children can't be taught musical notation, they have to be taught how to use lmms<sup>[5]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">teaching children musical notation is fraud, musical notation is for people who are ready to study existing music.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Kids just want to compose at first, and they don't actually know the full picture of what they want,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because their songs can make them money, just about all it takes is thinking of a song as six little songs ov varying complexity and instruments, they can upload that to bandcamp.com or similar.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There would need to exist a music label for students, so that their music can get on spotify and the radio,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am sure there are many companies that would love to do that for free, passing on all the profits on students, if not one would be created for that purpose.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Of course in the music class of today,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we are taught nonsense, and pushed along to memorize for the final and put it all behind us, in preparations for poverty resulting from unforgivable student loans.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Finally, before I looked at schools, I realized that Audio Books can help prison inmates a great deal,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is not possible to describe the importance of easy access to beautiful narrated books in prisons.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I would ask celebrities, to specifically create a prison version of a narration,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a separate narration from what is given to school students.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Some people aren't willing to read for high school kids,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but would be greatly honored, and in fact greatly appreciated, if they narrated great books for inmates.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is so important,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">history will not look kindly at mass incarceration and legal slavery, they will not look kindly at our ignorance and arrogance, and failure to prevent children from becoming criminals.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And here we arrive at an explanation of the very architecture,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">of the new school.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is no building, no rent, and no fraudulent moochers, or big fat white lice, not to mention spoiled lemons,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that pretend to teach children.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Parent's don't get to use school as a convenient baby sitter,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">actually the stress of High School and College, exposes children to drugs, school is a pretty nasty baby sitter.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A tablet, large, free to replace, open source Linux Tablet similar to the <span>PINETAB<sup>[6]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it presented to each student, there is a strong emphasis on socializing, and making friend in real life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>But not behind the brick wall of a class room (trigger warning)<sup>[7]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>children are not inmates, they are not meant to sit in rows memorizing noise, so that the teacher can take their fraudulent paycheck home<sup>[8]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">On the tablet there will be a series of programs, similar to the applications on the <span>OLPC XO<sup>[9]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but there will be one web application that will present a game like educational experience.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The students will still have stats, points or grades, this is somewhat kind of, similar to the <span>Dark Souls Player Status<sup>[10]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but here we will see things related to education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So passing and re-testing the Orbital Dynamics class,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will increase different stats, like math, physics, astrophysics.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The student while still in school, will be asked to re-play the challenges,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or games, that are used to refresh and refine their knowledge.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To mention Kerbal Space Program again,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">students only need to learn how to get into the orbit once, the test are only there to help retain knowledge.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is a real school and a real education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that is architected in such a way that the students end up getting contracts for well paying jobs, when their stats are high enough to qualify.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is Real Education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and because the student chooses their own path, it also becomes really fun and respectful of their existing predispositions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The kids that get stuck with making music,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are my favorite example.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Each school district will have a community of music makers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">who don't want to get a job, because they already make a lot of money.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The orbital dynamics class example I give here, requires a little bit more explanation,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">not all students that end up in the aerospace industry will begin with love for NASA.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Orbital Dynamics, is needed for several things, Generative Art Classes, Animation Classes, Computer Game Classes,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">whatever requires a decent knowledge of Netwon's calculus.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So it is not just this Orbital Dynamics class,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that pops up in a class list on their tablet.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is used by many courses,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and what makes a course outstanding, is that it helps the student with making money.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Due to money being misunderstood,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the world is cutting off the oxygen to its collective brain.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The classes presented to the students have to help the out of poverty,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Generative Art is about selling large beautiful canvas, with intricate high resolution computer art.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Some of those graphics, will be created by trails of objects that use Newton's Calculus,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">animation classes lead to a job in graphic arts, providing videos for advertising purposes, or as background to long winded poetry.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And computer game classes, help the students sell apps, and games,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">here lmms is a good example, it helps a person compose in less than an hour, and there are game engines that won't require years of programming.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Level design can be a big subject<sup>[11]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but a lot of players are a lot better at level design than they assume.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The tools that are used for building the levels,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are often part of the game, <span>it just makes sense to be within the walls of the game to make the levels more intricate<sup>[12]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Some programming will be required, and that is the area that would call for Orbital Dynamics and Calculus,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in a first person shooter the math would be related to animations, in a game like <span>asteroids<sup>[13]</sup></span> larger asteroids would attract the smaller ones with the force of gravity.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Graduation is about successfully learning something that results in pushing away poverty,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in a perfect world education would be more pure, but in a world that misunderstood how to use money, money making must be taught in school.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Jut to repeat my opening remarks,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">schools shy away from real results and noble aims, because they don't know how to educate, they are a place where adults go to make money under the protection of a union and an ineffective cirricula.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real school is a much more personal experience,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the access point is a computer tablet with Open Source software, where companies can't trick students into paying for what should be free.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The removal of stress that students experience when they realize they are being forced to pretend to learn by memorization or fail the class,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will already make a big difference.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Letting the students choose their own path,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and creating paths that help students become financially independent, will take care of the rest.</div>
</div>
