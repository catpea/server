  <p>Each generation, including yours, Dear Reader,</p>
  <p>is charged with figuring out, what is wrong.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Previous generations discovered many wrongs,</p>
  <p>Wars, Racism, Inequality, Lack of Education.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Due to ineffective schooling and resulting lack of education,</p>
  <p>we continue repeating mistakes of previous generations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The primary cause to repetitions of mistakes and their re-emergence,</p>
  <p>is lack of real education that grants the student knowledge, independence, wisdom, and eventual greatness.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Liars everywhere, in the blindness caused by lack of education,</p>
  <p>are easily out-competing generations of beings who dedicated their lives to the betterment of Human Kind.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Children are forced to memorize and pretend to learn to get good grades,</p>
  <p>and hope to go to colleges and universities that hardly live up to their promises.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Their job search, and school loans,</p>
  <p>the way they are treated from interview to retirement does not do them justice.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The younger generations are the Sacred Hope and Future of Human Hind,</p>
  <p>but they are now exploited by old fat lice who cannot stop feeding even if their life depends on it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The teachers in their haste to bring a little paycheck home have lost the respect for students,</p>
  <p>professors now sell home-made textbooks as ineffective as their lectures, and universities.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The children can see all this,</p>
  <p>they understand the minds of these failures.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>They merely need to ask:</p>
  <p>&quot;How would I have to think, and how low would I have to sink, to do as they do.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Humanity requires a real educational system to effectively pass knowledge between generations,</p>
  <p>when we finally create it, we will see blind stupidity and all the evils it fuels, fade.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>My friends, this is not a difficult project,</p>
  <p>we come together to record video lectures, write and narrate books.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We pay,</p>
  <p>for outstanding contributions and translations of these lectures.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>That payment,</p>
  <p>is the grade.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We create a massively multiplying and overlapping global educational system,</p>
  <p>that has no structure, and countless redundant paths towards knowledge, excellence and wisdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Those paths,</p>
  <p>are the diploma.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Companies that show compassion, worth and balance,</p>
  <p>inspect these paths in search of talent.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Even so, students are encouraged to build multi-founder start-ups,</p>
  <p>throughout the world and their lives.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>This world school, is not an neat addition to this world,</p>
  <p>this school: Becomes Our World.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It becomes our point of convergence on World Peace,</p>
  <p>and the Library of Ideas worth keeping.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The fundamentally broken naysayers will come,</p>
  <p>as the erosion of the good ideas and propagation of war, poverty, and all other bad ideas is their food.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But those who stand against Prosperity, Unity, Knowledge, Wisdom and World Peace,</p>
  <p>are just an animated rotting corpse that needs to be left behind in the poverty and desperation they once exploited to their advantage.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>For the sake of the future generations,</p>
  <p>let us rise against evil and mediocrity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>May we abandon all that moves against the grain of reality,</p>
  <p>and all that is fake, ineffective, and lacking positive, real, and permanent results.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Let us cradle the future generations in Knowledge, in Wisdom, and in Greatness,</p>
  <p>and honor them and their challenges, with World Peace.</p>
