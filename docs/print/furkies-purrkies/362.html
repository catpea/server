      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Little Adventures At Nordhouse Dunes</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I parked at a little wooded rest area,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was already nearing Ludington I didn't need to stop.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But I had some tasty crackers with me,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and I wasn't actually in any hurry to get anywhere at all.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This was early morning,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and it is not possible to describe that early morning fragrance.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It was the middle of summer,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and everything was blooming, everything was alive.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Mornings were especially thick with the scent of pine trees,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and endless, endless deep and dark woods.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I put the key in the ignition, and my power inverter cheerfully tweeted at me,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">followed by the GPS babbling something about a turn.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Highway 31 ended, and in a split second decision, if you can call it that,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I turned right on US 10, I was going to skip Ludington and head straight for Nordhouse.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I usually take North Stiles Road, until it ends at West Townline Rd</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and then I turn left onto North Quaterline Rd.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Here when I am headed straight for the wilderness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I turn left on West Nurnberg Rd which leads to a neat parking area.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This time I drive a little but further and did a left turn on West Forest Trail Rd,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this leads to a day camp area if you keep going forward where the road changes name to Porter Creek.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But I took the well manicured left turn keeping on West Forest Trail Rd,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and took it all the way until the end passing hundreds of happy campers and fancy sites.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I parked at the loop where the road ended, paid a few dollars for few days of parking my car,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and set off for the Nordhouse Wildernes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I made it up the first hill, and sat down for a moment, a lovely couple walked by with a big dog,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that was proudly trotting with a very funny little-backpack on.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I thought to myself, I'd be happy too if I was carrying my snacks with me,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">alas, I ate mine at the rest area, which now seemed like a terrible mistake.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I waited a moment to let the couple go on ahead of me,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so that they could have the wilderness to themselves.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Slowly put my backpack on, which was heavy, with all the water,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and went on my way.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I was kind of half-heatedly looking for a nice site looking down from the top of the ancient dune,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you know I got to tell you, there was this unusual cool breeze which in the warm air felt like a miracle.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The smell was even more beautiful, I think if I tried to describe it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I would end up crying, it is the fragrance of Happy and Healthy Nature.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I thought to my self if visitors from outer-space find this planet,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">many will just end up going hiking to all the world's destinations to just sniff the woods.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I switched my Audio Book from Seth Shostack's "Search for Intelligent Life in Space" lectures,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to Bill Bryon's A Walk In The Woods.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It was only later that I found out that bears were re-introduced to Nordhouse,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">now that I think about it, it was probably on top of a bunch of bears quietly living there already.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It took a few moments to actually get to the sign that indicates that,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this is the Nordhouse Wilderness Area,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Few moments later the sites started popping up,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you can see patches of well worn exposed dirt where hikers or hunters camp, they are all very nice.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Mine ended up being the second or third, it was small and beautiful,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but to get there I had to descend down the ancient dune, not exactly an easy task with a heavy backpack on.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I set up my tent, and took to gathering up firewood for the evening,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">especially the chunky fallen logs which people usually can't carry as they can't chop them in pieces.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I bring a sharp saw, really sharp,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the dry fallen logs are much easier to cut and carry.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This time people dragged a huge fallen tree into the site,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they were using it for sitting, so I used that for fire, and to clean up the site so that there is nothing left but dirt.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Not sure what time it was but the sun was still up high,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so I set off for a long walk down the beach.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The dunes are very beautiful studded with big old trees,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">every-time you look you discover something different, a break in the tree line, or a sandy area where the dune parted for some reason,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Or in this case an exceptionally tall stretch of dune,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">way taller than even I expected.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When I got back from my sunny walk,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I decided to walk the same distance, but now on the Arrowhead Trail in the woods.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I almost felt guilty about the beauty that was surrounding me,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and then I made an amazing discovery.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There was a fork in the trail that I have never noticed before,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the right path lead to a less worn trail that led up that gigantic dune I saw earlier.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just as I was getting comfortable with being speechless about all the beauty around me,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">things became even more beautiful.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To get to the top of the high dune you had to climb the cutest little trail,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that dune could be one of the most beautiful features of Nordhouse.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And looking towards Lake Michigan you kind of see the lake in a new light as well,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it looks, well, more beautiful from that height as you get to see more waves, and what seems like a more distant horizon.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When I finally made it to the highest spot,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I checked for ants and bears, and sat down on a log, speechless.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When I finally took it all in, I had a drink of water,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and of all the things, my phone beeped that it had a signal.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Happy with my discoveries, I begun my descent and just kept slowly walking back,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was going through a phase where I was re-listening to "Electric Universe, The Shocking True Story Of Electricity." over and over.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When I got to my camp, I just kept walking forward, as if it was a strangers tent down there,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and I made it back to my car.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The amazing fact about the West Forest Trail Rd is that it's other end,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is a gas station by a continuation of US 31, this is a whole new stretch.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The US 31 is connected by about four and a half miles of US 10,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is very strange, I just see them as two endings.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You don't need much when you live in the wilderness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">some crackers, a bit of ice cream, and a sausage.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I paid for my snacks and cheerfully described to the employees my journey thus far,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I had to hurry back it is a 10 mile drive but it is beautiful.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When I made it back to camp, I hung up my food in the tree,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">even though in my experience there aren't any raccoons down there, and went down to m beach.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I circled around waiting for the sunset, probably found a fossil or two,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and finally sat down to watch the sun put on a show.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It got a little bit cooler almost instantly,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I took to lighting the fire and roasting my sausage on one of the twigs I found earlier.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">By the time all the stars came out I was already in my sleeping bag,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">watching them through the netting, as I fell asleep to the Electric Universe.</div>
