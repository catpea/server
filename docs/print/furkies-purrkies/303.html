  <p>There is little to stop life&apos;s misfortunes from happening,</p>
  <p>but we can learn to face them in great dignity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>All misfortunes can be conquered with wisdom,</p>
  <p>the act of rising from misfortunes grants our life a greater meaning.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>With what we learn we can spare others the same pains,</p>
  <p>thusly making our own aches count for more.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>If all we have, to deal with great challenges,</p>
  <p>is a diploma and a career, than that will not be enough for us.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We need enough wisdom in our soul or the content of our character,</p>
  <p>to become in-compressible, and unbreakable.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Life must go on, we must rise against all odds,</p>
  <p>no evil, no meaningless suffering, no liar is to hold us down.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The most powerful part of us that drives all the rest,</p>
  <p>is wisdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Wisdom is like a flower, and it grows within books,</p>
  <p>whatever our challenge, great beings faced similar circumstance.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And so that their aches did not get lost,</p>
  <p>they turned them into wisdom, and the only way to reliably share wisdom is books.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A well narrated book can give a person great strength in a very short time,</p>
  <p>and when our soul hurts the most our mind becomes extremely receptive to wisdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is best, I think, to read books, or listen to their narrated versions,</p>
  <p>ahead of time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Books also enhance our decision making,</p>
  <p>so that we may avoid hopelessness altogether.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The only thing that can give us great trouble,</p>
  <p>is not having access to well respected and meaningful books that change lives with wisdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Because then we will need to rebuild the path to greatness from zero,</p>
  <p>and that may take decades if not more.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>There is a problem with books because reading them is not the best way to inherit their wisdom,</p>
  <p>the best way is to have them beautifully read to us.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Not only that but in order to hear the narrator well,</p>
  <p>we need a healthy mind and a balanced existence, a kind of a long and hard vacation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We need the healing power of nature, of hills, trees, moss and fern,</p>
  <p>little woodland springs, an occasional beach, warm nights and fragrant mornings.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>To understand a book, you need a fine narrator, and thick smell of pine trees,</p>
  <p>a cracking bonfire or cabin fireplace, and the certainty of knowing that you have tomorrow for yourself as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We are unable to inherit knowledge from books when our life is stressful,</p>
  <p>in stress the best we can do is temporary memorize.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But we have to appreciate the content of what is being said,</p>
  <p>not merely the words themselves, but the birth and life of the idea behind them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Learning requires the creation of a map or scaffold,</p>
  <p>and that can only be built when we love ourselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And once wisdom finally takes root within us, it cannot be removed in any way, wisdom grows, almost on its own,</p>
  <p>it grants us solutions to new problems by subtle analogy to that which we already understand.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And wisdom spreads, it is hard not to share good ideas,</p>
  <p>and it is hard to stop them from being shared.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Once equipped with wisdom,</p>
  <p>we can hear the chains of misfortune dragging a mile away, and we are, in a way, ready.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We stand with the many others that we met in books, but now creating a family in time and space,</p>
  <p>and now we fully appreciate their struggles and eventual triumph, and them taking the time to share their hard won wisdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And then we rise, we rise out of it all,</p>
  <p>in our struggle wisdom will bloom within us multiplying our strengths to no end.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Later in life we will be able to heal others,</p>
  <p>help them with their thoughts and towards their own synthesis of wisdom, and helping them to become just as unbreakable.</p>
