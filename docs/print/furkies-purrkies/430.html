    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Pay Attention To The Broken Things</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When you are sitting at your desk, in school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the teacher is regurgitating textbooks to get you to pass tests.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And you have no idea what the heck he is taking about, and you are not inclined to understand that everyone else is lost too,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and that the reason they are getting better grades than you, is because they aren't listening to comprehend, but to memorize.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Know, that he teacher can't rely on your comprehension skills,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because they won't risk getting into trouble over your actual understanding.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So what they will do, is look over the test you need to pass,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and then feed you information that will help you pass if you blindly memorize it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you don't understand,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that you are not supposed to understand.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you don't understand,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that you are only supposed to memorize to pass the tests so that they can put food on the table.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Then you are running the risk,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">of becoming convinced that you are unintelligent.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Which you are not,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the world is just not understanding how badly schools are broken.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have to pay attention,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to the broken things, and know when to walk.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All the broken things are equally toxic,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and you have to protect your mind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Sitting in rows, while being spoon-fed timed lectures, from a one-for-all curriculum that does not see you as a unique human being with a colorful imagination,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and then being graded down for not having temporarily-memorized it for long enough - is not an education, that's just fraud.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are manipulated into cramming,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so that the teacher can hold up the tests as evidence, that he is not a fraud.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are no standardized humans,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there cannot be a standardized assessment.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even in prestigious universities, and medical schools,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a standardized assessment can only asses the height you are standing on, while cutting out the entire being that you are.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In average schools, a standardized assessment can only asses,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">whether or not you have given up who you are, under the stress of being held back, and laughed at.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are no bad grades,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you either understand something or not.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A bad grade is a nail in the coffin of a school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it reveals its own fraud - and blames it on you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A school could be built to do you and your classmates justice,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but it would be an unstructured series of games, levels that would require actual study.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And when you fail to progress,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">nobody would know about it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It would not be the final test,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you'd find a better book and get to the bottom of what had you stuck.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Only your progression forward would matter,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you would never be punished for learning what you like at your own pace.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do not let broken things trick you into thinking there is something wrong with you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">do not let them hold you back from the real thing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Graded fantasy education that trick you into unforgivable-debt is an insult with a curse,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the real thing is blooming ecosystem of a thousand pursuits that you track the same way as the streets of a sprawling city.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is a road that will slowly meander towards wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">fake education may deny you that path.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Education is one-of-many examples of broken things,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and all the broken tings will obscure your path forward.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Try, try to figure it out ahead of time,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the elder you may look back and see that you didn't have all the necessary ideas, but also appreciate that you fought for truth.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Scientists are taught to question everything,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to search for evidence, avoid common mistakes, and to reproduce results.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Next time you get a bad grade in school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">don't feel bad, instead question how you were taught and whether or not that adds up to create any real and lasting results.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do not let the broken things and the actors that line their pockets with them trick you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and blame it all on you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Finally, if you want to learn Biology</div>
  <div class="paragraph">build a computer game that simulates everything we know.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you want to learn chemistry,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">build a virtual world that helps everyone visualize how everything works beneath the reaction.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you want to learn Physics</div>
  <div class="paragraph">build a game that simulates Humans taking to the stars.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To learn Mathematics,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">create generative art, games, and visualizations of all that we know.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you really want to learn for real,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then you will have to be the first one to build a real school.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Whatever you do, pay attention to the broken things,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">do not let anybody trick you and blame it all on you.</div>
