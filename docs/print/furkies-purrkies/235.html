  <p>I think that is how the great thinkers learned in the past,</p>
  <p>they would grab onto something like Gravitation, Electromagnetism, Pendulums,</p>
  <p>and try to figure out how they worked, what forces influenced the things they observed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Inventing and Invention, makes us think of Pet Rocks, Chia Pets, and Cheap Junk,</p>
  <p>but the true meaning of invention is following your path of curiosities.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>For example, aren&apos;t you curious about Infrared Photography?</p>
  <p>Infrared Lamps that but emit a faint red color, but light up an IR Photo,</p>
  <p>Infrared Camera for Raspberry PI Zero costs $12, and the UNIX based Raspberry PI Zero just about $20,</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Raspberry PI contains a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/raspbian/applications/camera.md">couple commands</a> with dozens of options that you can tinker with,</p>
  <p>from ISO, shutter speed, to options like brightness and contrast.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Just a simple curiosity can lead you on a path of exploring UNIX,</p>
  <p>Photography, the Light Spectrum, and even let you brush against Astrography.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Where you get to think about flaws in your Charge Coupled Device (CCD Sensor),</p>
  <p>and how you have to <a href="https://astrofloyd.wordpress.com/2013/10/27/astrophotography-with-imagemagick/">hunt down and eliminate the dead pixels</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And what great please it is to see that your photos are flawless,</p>
  <p>and then begin stacking them to average out and remove noise,</p>
  <p>all these little triumphs add to your Knowledge and Wisdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is OK to be overwhelmed, but it is not OK to shy away from something that captured your interest because it seems too confusing,</p>
  <p>the confusion just comes from not knowing all the steps to get to taking your first IR photo.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sajBySPeYH0">Start with the $150 8GB Raspberry PI 4</a>, get a couple of monitors,</p>
  <p>and create your first laboratory.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Then get the $20 Raspberry PI Zero, and you&apos;ll have your first computer network,</p>
  <p>with a satellite Raspberry Zero, that only requires power, so it just needs a single cable.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Attach the Noir Camera to it,</p>
  <p>and start exploring what it means to average images to eliminate noise.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Another Raspberry Zero,</p>
  <p>this time with a normal $9 camera, can watch your flowers with time laps photography.</p>

  <p>This is an example of a modern path of invention,</p>
  <p>from this point on, you get to choose your own next steps.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You can study Node.js, UNIX, Bash, and become a programmer,</p>
  <p>you can move on beyond the digital and buy your first $200 DIY 3D Printer,</p>
  <p>and for example print cases for your Raspberry PIs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>After some practice with the servo motors,</p>
  <p>you can build a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLoNKmoP8qY">Raspberry Powered Telescope</a>,</p>
  <p>that also doubles as a Deadly Space Laser, hey you never know, it is 2020 after all.</p>

  <p>This is how the Great Beings that invented the experiment of mandatory public education, learned.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Baby Step, by Baby Step.</p>
  <p>traveling a decades long journey with with curiosities and adventures.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A journey where every new step adds to the previous,</p>
  <p>to create a body of Knowledge and Wisdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>When you feel you hit a milestone, write a tutorial on how you did it,</p>
  <p>on what you improved, make some video tutorials, and put them on your resume,</p>
  <p>show your inventors or employer that you know that your mind has no limits,</p>
  <p>and that you are a Brilliant Inventor, and a Fine Scientist.</p>
