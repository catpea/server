      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Helping Humanity Grow in Wisdom</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Ability to connect with knowledge through audio-books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and retain that knowledge, as your own,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and build on it to no end, is beyond the powers of Universe.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Inheriting Knowledge to build Wisdom makes you unstoppable,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and once you sit down to write a book of your own you become infinite.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We should not allow anyone to stand between us and our education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">inheritance of knowledge is extremely important to our mental health,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to how we treat each other, and how we interact with the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Books are the loveliest things in the world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">my time listening to "A Short History of Nearly Everything" by Bill Bryson is such a wonderful memory.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I still smile at how shy Henry Cavendish was,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and sometimes I worry about a Kimberlite Pipes popping up somewhere nearby, you never know.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The part where Conway Morris muttered "...not another phylum.",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">got me when I was jogging in the middle of the night at Ann Arbor, MI,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I almost suffocated from laughter.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">See a school can't present knowledge this way,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I know that there are many amazing professors,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but most of them, probably have a fantastic book or series or lectures out.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Knowledge has to be presented with Love and Joy, and maybe a hint of Comedy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">schools of today are coldhearted machines incapable of those emotions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We can't just pass the tests that schools expect us to cram for,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we need the actual knowledge, and wonders that will help us become wise.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Life is always asking us to pick a direction,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the wiser we become early on, the happier we will be on the paths we chose.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We must not become tricked into believing we are bad at learning,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there is just no such thing as bad at learning.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Bad grades just prove that middle-school, high-school and college are seriously broken,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the kids that do get good grades and become successful learn outside of school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and they certainly do not cram before tests they actually learn.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Learning and Schools should not be two separate things,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and there should never be a threat of someone becoming tricked into thinking that they are not smart.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is a global problem,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the leaders and policy makes who did cram for tests,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they too need a real education that will contribute to their wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is not just about fixing High School,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this is about helping Humanity Grow in Wisdom.</div>
