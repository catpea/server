  <p>Ability to connect with knowledge through audio-books,</p>
  <p>and retain that knowledge, as your own,</p>
  <p>and build on it to no end, is beyond the powers of Universe.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Inheriting Knowledge to build Wisdom makes you unstoppable,</p>
  <p>and once you sit down to write a book of your own you become infinite.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We should not allow anyone to stand between us and our education,</p>
  <p>inheritance of knowledge is extremely important to our mental health,</p>
  <p>to how we treat each other, and how we interact with the world.</p>

  <p>Books are the loveliest things in the world,</p>
  <p>my time listening to &quot;A Short History of Nearly Everything&quot; by Bill Bryson is such a wonderful memory.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I still smile at how shy Henry Cavendish was,</p>
  <p>and sometimes I worry about a Kimberlite Pipes popping up somewhere nearby, you never know.</p>

  <p>The part where Conway Morris muttered &quot;...not another phylum.&quot;,</p>
  <p>got me when I was jogging in the middle of the night at Ann Arbor, MI,</p>
  <p>I almost suffocated from laughter.</p>

  <p>See a school can&apos;t present knowledge this way,</p>
  <p>I know that there are many amazing professors,</p>
  <p>but most of them, probably have a fantastic book or series or lectures out.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Knowledge has to be presented with Love and Joy, and maybe a hint of Comedy,</p>
  <p>schools of today are coldhearted machines incapable of those emotions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We can&apos;t just pass the tests that schools expect us to cram for,</p>
  <p>we need the actual knowledge, and wonders that will help us become wise.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Life is always asking us to pick a direction,</p>
  <p>the wiser we become early on, the happier we will be on the paths we chose.</p>

  <p>We must not become tricked into believing we are bad at learning,</p>
  <p>there is just no such thing as bad at learning.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Bad grades just prove that middle-school, high-school and college are seriously broken,</p>
  <p>the kids that do get good grades and become successful learn outside of school,</p>
  <p>and they certainly do not cram before tests they actually learn.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Learning and Schools should not be two separate things,</p>
  <p>and there should never be a threat of someone becoming tricked into thinking that they are not smart.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>This is a global problem,</p>
  <p>the leaders and policy makes who did cram for tests,</p>
  <p>they too need a real education that will contribute to their wisdom.</p>
