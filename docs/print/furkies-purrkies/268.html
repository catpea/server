  <p>Lack of education must be recognized as the highest threat,</p>

  <p>We are not to force children into poverty,</p>

  <p>Privacy is to be recognized,</p>

  <p>The younger generations are sacred,</p>
  <p>and they are to be honored by free and effective education.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>They are to be granted privacy,</p>
  <p>free acres to any and all educational materials and all books, including audio books.</p>

  <p>Know that parents are often victims to their cognitive biases,</p>
  <p>out of lack of education, out of never having met a real teacher.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Know, with all certainty that borders are wrong,</p>
  <p>they are a symptom of poison that our biases drive into us when unchecked.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The effects of our cognitive biases burn brightest and spread fastest,</p>
  <p>when fueled by lack of education; poverty of mind and wallet.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The world of today is choking on chaos born from lack of education and wisdom,</p>
  <p>prestigious positions are taken up by lying pretenders whose only aim is to fake it until they make it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>They are unaware of their lack of education,</p>
  <p>they do not know what wisdom is, most of them just want to feed to no end.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Only in wisdom can the world become what it is mean to be,</p>
  <p>one home, for us all, our entire family.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We are only divided by levels of education,</p>
  <p>in Wisdom we are one, and we are each Unique and Infinitely Beautiful.</p>

  <p>You are not so serve, you are the future,</p>
  <p>you are to lead the world to unity and wisdom.</p>

  <p>In poverty certain imaginary things spread in our minds like viruses,</p>
  <p>they are fueled by fear, darkness, uncertainty and lack of education.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>They become a beacon to those who like to frighten,</p>
  <p>and take enlightenment away with threats punishment for no other reason than to tower and feed.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>It your great responsibility to set yourself free,</p>
  <p>do not be a slave to a cult.</p>
</div>

  <p>You are meant to become a Wise Being by listening to and reading books,</p>
  <p>and you are meant to become a Great Being by helping your loved ones and even some of your enemies towards enlightenment and freedom.</p>

  <p>If a school is not teaching you,</p>
  <p>then it is not a school, and you have to find a real one.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>Do not become tricked by a mere impression of education,</p>
  <p>you don&apos;t need a job, you need to be a business owner, and a leader.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We need you to stand as competition to overpriced medicine and companies that violate human rights for profit,</p>
  <p>to corporations that cannot have hearts and slick talking psychopaths, who will never see value in helping you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Especially those who announce themselves with,</p>
  <p>with bite sized lies.</p>

  <p>Build you own schools out of books,</p>
  <p>may you share libraries.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>May you build schools free of shame, judgment, pressure to cheat, and threat punishment,</p>
  <p>or prison - which is what being held back is.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>Share your wisdom amongst each other,</p>
  <p>tell the world about your parents in audiobooks and torrents of videos.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Question poverty, question profit maximization,</p>
  <p>and the betrayals of privacy, leadership, and even organized education.</p>

  <p>The internet is for you to connect and see that we are all the same,</p>
  <p>we all love your humor, and relish in and learn much your insults.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The internet will remain in place as we all wait for you to connect the world together,</p>
  <p>we built it for you and we will protect it until you make the borders that divide humanity, irrelevant.</p>

  <p>We fill and re-fill libraries with inspiration and wisdom to help you grow faster,</p>
  <p>to help you gain visions with clarity that is not available to us - and it is working.</p>

  <p>Always reject status quo and question authority,</p>
  <p>especially their biases and down to their marrow until all they have left to speak is, that ounce of truth they do know.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Without wisdom, desperate men can only blindly-and-automatically, repeat history&apos;s mistakes,</p>
  <p>those who have no wisdom have no authority over you, YOU ARE THE FUTURE.</p>

  <p>Happiness is not something you can pursue, that&apos;s impossible,</p>
  <p>nor life is a journey to some imaginary destination, we can only return to the nothingness we emerged from.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Happiness must ensue, and it will only appear in lives of wisdom,</p>
  <p>it is not a feeling can capture and hold, it is a gravity that will overwhelm and lovingly crush you every day, forever.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The road ahead of you, is extremely long,</p>
  <p>and requires hundreds of years of work.</p>

  <p>But the future is beautiful,</p>
  <p>it is more beautiful than any of us alive today can imagine.</p>

  <p>Take to audio books on the subjects of Adventure, Philosophy, Wisdom, Science, Greatness and Growing Up, immediately,</p>
  <p>and take what you learn to school, do not let teachers trick you into cramming and blame it on you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The world is standing still, the sooner you stand up for Wisdom and deliver,</p>
  <p>the sooner the future will come.

  <p>You are the teachers now.</p>
