  <div class="paragraph">Lack of education must be recognized as the highest threat,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to the security of our world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are not to force children into poverty,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by selling a mere impression of knowledge.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Privacy is to be recognized,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as a Basic Human right.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And those of you who hate, or just laugh,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">know in no uncertain terms, that you will be forgotten.</div>

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The younger generations are sacred,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and they are to be honored by free and effective education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They are to be granted privacy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">free acres to any and all educational materials and all books, including audio books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Those of you who are looking to turn a profit,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by dangling education as a carrot, will be forgotten in disgrace.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Rest of my note,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is for the Children.</div>

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Know that parents are often victims to their cognitive biases,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">out of lack of education, out of never having met a real teacher.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Know, with all certainty that borders are wrong,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they are a symptom of poison that our biases drive into us when unchecked.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The effects of our cognitive biases burn brightest and spread fastest,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when fueled by lack of education; poverty of mind and wallet.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The world of today is choking on chaos born from lack of education and wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">prestigious positions are taken up by lying pretenders whose only aim is to fake it until they make it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They are unaware of their lack of education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they do not know what wisdom is, most of them just want to feed to no end.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Only in wisdom can the world become what it is mean to be,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">one home, for us all, our entire family.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are only divided by levels of education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in Wisdom we are one, and we are each Unique and Infinitely Beautiful.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are not so serve, you are the future,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you are to lead the world to unity and wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In poverty certain imaginary things spread in our minds like viruses,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they are fueled by fear, darkness, uncertainty and lack of education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They become a beacon to those who like to frighten,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and take enlightenment away with threats punishment for no other reason than to tower and feed.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It your great responsibility to set yourself free,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">do not be a slave to a cult.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are meant to become a Wise Being by listening to and reading books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and you are meant to become a Great Being by helping your loved ones and even some of your enemies towards enlightenment and freedom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If a school is not teaching you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then it is not a school, and you have to find a real one.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do not become tricked by a mere impression of education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you don't need a job, you need to be a business owner, and a leader.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We need you to stand as competition to overpriced medicine and companies that violate human rights for profit,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to corporations that cannot have hearts and slick talking psychopaths, who will never see value in helping you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Especially those who announce themselves with,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with bite sized lies.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Build you own schools out of books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">may you share libraries.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">May you build schools free of shame, judgment, pressure to cheat, and threat punishment,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or prison - which is what being held back is.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Share your wisdom amongst each other,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">tell the world about your parents in audiobooks and torrents of videos.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Question poverty, question profit maximization,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the betrayals of privacy, leadership, and even organized education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The internet is for you to connect and see that we are all the same,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we all love your humor, and relish in and learn much your insults.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The internet will remain in place as we all wait for you to connect the world together,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we built it for you and we will protect it until you make the borders that divide humanity, irrelevant.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We fill and re-fill libraries with inspiration and wisdom to help you grow faster,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to help you gain visions with clarity that is not available to us - and it is working.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Always reject status quo and question authority,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">especially their biases and down to their marrow until all they have left to speak is, that ounce of truth they do know.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Without wisdom, desperate men can only blindly-and-automatically, repeat history's mistakes,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">those who have no wisdom have no authority over you, YOU ARE THE FUTURE.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are to make Audio Books out of Love,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">not wars out of incompetence, fear and hate.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Happiness is not something you can pursue, that's impossible,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">nor life is a journey to some imaginary destination, we can only return to the nothingness we emerged from.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Happiness must ensue, and it will only appear in lives of wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is not a feeling can capture and hold, it is a gravity that will overwhelm and lovingly crush you every day, forever.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The road ahead of you, is extremely long,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and requires hundreds of years of work.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But the future is beautiful,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is more beautiful than any of us alive today can imagine.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Take to audio books on the subjects of Adventure, Philosophy, Wisdom, Science, Greatness and Growing Up, immediately,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and take what you learn to school, do not let teachers trick you into cramming and blame it on you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The world is standing still, the sooner you stand up for Wisdom and deliver,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the sooner the future will come.
  </div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are the teachers now.</div>
