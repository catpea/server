  <p>A new age is coming,</p>
  <p>an age where the younger generations will end tolerance of blind mistakes.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>There will be no more business as usual,</p>
  <p>for there was never a usual to be had.</p>

  <p>The children can see that borders are hurting the world,</p>
  <p>political, cultural, and religious borders keep humanity divided and weak.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>The only reason for their tolerance of our mistakes today,</p>
  <p>is that they still believe in us, they still think we have the answers they are looking for.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But with internet, and disasters, climate change, and continued threats of nuclear war,</p>
  <p>more and more children learn to see that Humanity cannot grow as it is today.</p>

  <p>The revolution will be silent,</p>
  <p>there will be no battle, they will just wait us out.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>They didn&apos;t even need us to do anything special,</p>
  <p>just end their poverty, and give them real schools.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>They will watch the videos of us helplessly bailing out corruption,</p>
  <p>spouting nonsense about how poverty can&apos;t be fixed, because that&apos;s not how money works.</p>

  <p>All the way down,</p>

  <p>This is not a poem about Global Warming and Economic Collapse,</p>
  <p>this is a poem about Naked Emperors, and Authenticity.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>This is a poem about Real Schools,</p>
  <p>that make a real difference for all the kids, most of which still look up to us.</p>

  <p>Elementary school is working,</p>
  <p>it is perfect, and those teachers are still The Cheerful Heroes they have always been.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>Middle School, breaks down under fake education,</p>
  <p>as we fail to teach tools for thinking, and sell our children for a small paycheck.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>High School, is where the kids figure out it is all fake,</p>
  <p>and come home with bad grades to call you out.</p>

  <p>College and University,</p>
  <p>finally manages to break their beautiful hearts.</p>

  <p>Open curriculum, brand name education, networking with the past graduates, lose leaf text books,</p>
  <p>debt, and sweet infantile dean feeling shy for wearing the school brand underwear, that one last day of the semester.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>That was not a graduation speech old man, that was pain and fear,</p>
  <p>that was the declaration that the Emperor is Naked.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>The best of the kids who do go through the process,</p>
  <p>learn that the can but help a person, a village, but there is no way for them to help the whole world.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>Jumping all the hoops does not provide the solutions the entire world needs,</p>
  <p>we have to have faith in the future generations enabled by real education, that is our only hope.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Give the kids a school, that will teach them for real,</p>
  <p>while there is still a better future to be had.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>A school that is worthy of the Infinitely Creative Genius that they really are,</p>
  <p>stop pushing them through the mockery of education that removes their unique connection to Knowledge,</p>
  <p>and replaces it with Memorization and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzSnvxejenY">Fake Grades</a></p>

  <p>Each Human Being has a unique way of connecting with Knowledge and Wisdom,</p>
  <p>and every one of those ways has a path that moves at a perfect pace-and-sequence through the sciences.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It can be music, and then Alan Walker, and lmms, and a cover of Alone,</p>
  <p>and then the world of programming, and mathematics and signal processing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It can be Games, Graphics, Game Design, Trigonometry,</p>
  <p>Astrophysics, and Orbital Dynamics, and Astrobiology.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It can be Art, a tin of pencils, and a classroom of students,</p>
  <p>and inspiration, and speaking, and internship at the UN, and finally Presidency.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It can be Adventure, and bugs, and Photography,</p>
  <p>and Film Making, and the Documentary that helps Earth awake in time.</p>

  <p>Their paths are much shorter then the ones that strip them off their natural predispositions,</p>
  <p>and confine them into rows like slaves,</p>
  <p>and cut up knowledge into preached cubes void of sense,</p>
  <p>and slow them down to a crawl by presenting incomprehensible lectures,</p>
  <p>and memorization games for nothing.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>That stupid pointless aim, to keep getting funding,</p>
  <p>and pay the staff, so that everyone keeps their crappy jobs,</p>
  <p>at the price of the future, and the best minds of our generation.</p>

  <p>The result of this madness,</p>
  <p>is children losing faith in their own Genius,</p>
  <p>and in the Power of Education, and Knowledge and Wisdom.</p>

  <p>This is where whoever is left,</p>
  <p>that still has strength left,</p>
  <p>needs to step in.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>Help them regain the belief that they are geniuses,</p>
  <p>and that we are all equally gifted.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>Help them to Audio Books,</p>
  <p>because schools are now hurting them.</p>

  <p>Do not let the Little Ones,</p>
  <p>give up on their Genius.</p>

  <p>we must all comprehend the world&apos;s leading science books.</p>
