      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Help Them Believe In Their Genius</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A new age is coming,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">an age where the younger generations will end tolerance of blind mistakes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There will be no more business as usual,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for there was never a usual to be had.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The children can see that borders are hurting the world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">political, cultural, and religious borders keep humanity divided and weak.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The only reason for their tolerance of our mistakes today,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is that they still believe in us, they still think we have the answers they are looking for.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But with internet, and disasters, climate change, and continued threats of nuclear war,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">more and more children learn to see that Humanity cannot grow as it is today.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They are the future,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and it is their future.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The revolution will be silent,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there will be no battle, they will just wait us out.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They didn't even need us to do anything special,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">just end their poverty, and give them real schools.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They will watch the videos of us helplessly bailing out corruption,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">spouting nonsense about how poverty can't be fixed, because that's not how money works.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All the way down,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">until all markets collapse to nothing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is not a poem about Global Warming and Economic Collapse,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this is a poem about Naked Emperors, and Authenticity.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is a poem about Real Schools,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that make a real difference for all the kids, most of which still look up to us.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Elementary school is working,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is perfect, and those teachers are still The Cheerful Heroes they have always been.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Middle School, breaks down under fake education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as we fail to teach tools for thinking, and sell our children for a small paycheck.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">High School, is where the kids figure out it is all fake,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and come home with bad grades to call you out.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">College and University,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">finally manages to break their beautiful hearts.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Open curriculum, brand name education, networking with the past graduates, lose leaf text books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">debt, and sweet infantile dean feeling shy for wearing the school brand underwear, that one last day of the semester.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That was not a graduation speech old man, that was pain and fear,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that was the declaration that the Emperor is Naked.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The best of the kids who do go through the process,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">learn that the can but help a person, a village, but there is no way for them to help the whole world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Jumping all the hoops does not provide the solutions the entire world needs,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we have to have faith in the future generations enabled by real education, that is our only hope.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Give the kids a school, that will teach them for real,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">while there is still a better future to be had.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A school that is worthy of the Infinitely Creative Genius that they really are,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">stop pushing them through the mockery of education that removes their unique connection to Knowledge,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and replaces it with Memorization and <span>Fake Grades<sup>[1]</sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Each Human Being has a unique way of connecting with Knowledge and Wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and every one of those ways has a path that moves at a perfect pace-and-sequence through the sciences.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It can be music, and then Alan Walker, and lmms, and a cover of Alone,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and then the world of programming, and mathematics and signal processing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It can be Games, Graphics, Game Design, Trigonometry,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Astrophysics, and Orbital Dynamics, and Astrobiology.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It can be Art, a tin of pencils, and a classroom of students,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and inspiration, and speaking, and internship at the UN, and finally Presidency.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It can be Adventure, and bugs, and Photography,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and Film Making, and the Documentary that helps Earth awake in time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Their paths are much shorter then the ones that strip them off their natural predispositions,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and confine them into rows like slaves,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and cut up knowledge into preached cubes void of sense,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and slow them down to a crawl by presenting incomprehensible lectures,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and memorization games for nothing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That stupid pointless aim, to keep getting funding,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and pay the staff, so that everyone keeps their crappy jobs,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">at the price of the future, and the best minds of our generation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The result of this madness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is children losing faith in their own Genius,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and in the Power of Education, and Knowledge and Wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is where whoever is left,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that still has strength left,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">needs to step in.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Help them regain the belief that they are geniuses,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and that we are all equally gifted.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Help them to Audio Books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because schools are now hurting them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do not let the Little Ones,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">give up on their Genius.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are all gifted, we are all geniuses,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we must all comprehend the world's leading science books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We must all grow in Authenticity, in Dignity,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in Insight and Foresight.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
