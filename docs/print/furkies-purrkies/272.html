    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">You Are Not Wrong</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If something is wrong somewhere,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you are not the only one to care.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are others that will fight beside you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so as long as your cause is just and true.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Some will fight by subtle analogy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">learn from them, and their lack of apology.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Speaking out will set you free,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">even though many will come to disagree.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our lives are unfortunately much too short,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but good things will come and you'll find comfort.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are afforded a handful of miracles,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and those certainly will aid to your cause.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Most importantly remember to just speak out,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the change is up to the people that you bring about.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your voice is one but a million is required,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so only speak, and never go past getting tired.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Whatever it is that you will say,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">do not forget about Love not even for a day.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Personal Note,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I seem to babble on about many things,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but the first wrong that hurt me was school.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So when I think about helping the world grow,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the first thing that comes to mind is fixing it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I am really worried about the ease,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with which we can be indoctrinated into false beliefs.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I mean we are all born into a world</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with intercontinental ballistic missiles pointed at all cities.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We accept this all to easily,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">most of us never pays any attention.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The mechanism behind our blind acceptance.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is also the same mechanism that may launch them someday.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To really see all the things we need to fix,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we have to wiggle ourselves out of any and all indoctrinations.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One of our most powerful superpowers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is thinking by subtle analogy to something else.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That is one of the mechanisms that powers our wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we can see or solve problems based on other things we find in books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are three people that influenced my ideas about education the most,</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Richard Dawkins<sup>[1]</sup></span>, <span>Erica Goldson<sup>[2]</sup></span>, and the <span>Saintly Sir Ken Robinson<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When I look at them, I feel like I copied everything from them,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but that's just means we are all fighting toward similar goals.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The thing that sticks out about me is this notion of wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I absolutely believe that we are all great thinkers that eventually become wise.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And unlike Sir Robinson who urges to reform,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or Miss Godson who want to work together.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I mostly want to encourage students to stop trusting schools,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and accept the responsibility for their own education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I do not think that being bombarded by mixtures of lessons and homework,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is good for learning, I think it only induces cramming, and renders a student uneducated.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Sir Robinson mentions,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that there is a small percentage of students that do thrive in school.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But you see what Erica Goldson is saying,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">she's is only good at passing tests, and she's scared.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Richard Dawkins is a scientist who urges people,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to focus on the The Magic of Reality, rather than any other magic.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The way he takes to the stage,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the way he moves an audience.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">His dignity and certainty of knowing-that he is correct,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and that he is helping the world grow, is an perfect example of a Great Being.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The title of this text,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">comes from a question asked by a young [presumably religions] lady: "<span>What if you're wrong?<sup>[4]</sup></span>"</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I urge you to look it up on the internet to hear his response,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and to see what a being hoping to help the world grow really looks like.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One of the most heartbreakingly powerful things that comes to my mind in regards to his work,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is him visiting a school where <span>children are being indoctrinated into the belief that Noah and his Ark are absolutely real<sup>[5]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">These children can't know otherwise,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it becomes their very reality.</div>
</div>
