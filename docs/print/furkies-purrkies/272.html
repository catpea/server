  <p>If something is wrong somewhere,</p>
  <p>you are not the only one to care.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>There are others that will fight beside you,</p>
  <p>so as long as your cause is just and true.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Some will fight by subtle analogy,</p>
  <p>learn from them, and their lack of apology.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Speaking out will set you free,</p>
  <p>even though many will come to disagree.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Our lives are unfortunately much too short,</p>
  <p>but good things will come and you&apos;ll find comfort.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We are afforded a handful of miracles,</p>
  <p>and those certainly will aid to your cause.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Most importantly remember to just speak out,</p>
  <p>the change is up to the people that you bring about.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Your voice is one but a million is required,</p>
  <p>so only speak, and never go past getting tired.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Whatever it is that you will say,</p>
  <p>do not forget about Love not even for a day.</p>

  <p>Personal Note,</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I seem to babble on about many things,</p>
  <p>but the first wrong that hurt me was school.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>So when I think about helping the world grow,</p>
  <p>the first thing that comes to mind is fixing it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I am really worried about the ease,</p>
  <p>with which we can be indoctrinated into false beliefs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I mean we are all born into a world</p>
  <p>with intercontinental ballistic missiles pointed at all cities.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We accept this all to easily,</p>
  <p>most of us never pays any attention.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The mechanism behind our blind acceptance.</p>
  <p>is also the same mechanism that may launch them someday.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>To really see all the things we need to fix,</p>
  <p>we have to wiggle ourselves out of any and all indoctrinations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>One of our most powerful superpowers,</p>
  <p>is thinking by subtle analogy to something else.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>That is one of the mechanisms that powers our wisdom,</p>
  <p>we can see or solve problems based on other things we find in books.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>There are three people that influenced my ideas about education the most,</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Richard+Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M4tdMsg3ts">Erica Goldson</a>, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Sir+Ken+Robinson">Saintly Sir Ken Robinson</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>When I look at them, I feel like I copied everything from them,</p>
  <p>but that&apos;s just means we are all fighting toward similar goals.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The thing that sticks out about me is this notion of wisdom,</p>
  <p>I absolutely believe that we are all great thinkers that eventually become wise.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And unlike Sir Robinson who urges to reform,</p>
  <p>or Miss Godson who want to work together.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I mostly want to encourage students to stop trusting schools,</p>
  <p>and accept the responsibility for their own education.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I do not think that being bombarded by mixtures of lessons and homework,</p>
  <p>is good for learning, I think it only induces cramming, and renders a student uneducated.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Sir Robinson mentions,</p>
  <p>that there is a small percentage of students that do thrive in school.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But you see what Erica Goldson is saying,</p>
  <p>she&apos;s is only good at passing tests, and she&apos;s scared.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Richard Dawkins is a scientist who urges people,</p>
  <p>to focus on the The Magic of Reality, rather than any other magic.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The way he takes to the stage,</p>
  <p>and the way he moves an audience.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>His dignity and certainty of knowing-that he is correct,</p>
  <p>and that he is helping the world grow, is an perfect example of a Great Being.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The title of this text,</p>
  <p>comes from a question asked by a young [presumably religions] lady: &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mmskXXetcg">What if you&apos;re wrong?</a>&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I urge you to look it up on the internet to hear his response,</p>
  <p>and to see what a being hoping to help the world grow really looks like.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>One of the most heartbreakingly powerful things that comes to my mind in regards to his work,</p>
  <p>is him visiting a school where <a href="https://youtu.be/uQ7GvwUsJ7w?t=3450">children are being indoctrinated into the belief that Noah and his Ark are absolutely real</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>These children can&apos;t know otherwise,</p>
  <p>it becomes their very reality.</p>
