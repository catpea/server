  <p>The only thing keeping us back, is lack of wisdom,</p>
  <p>this is occurring because the world places no emphasis on becoming wise.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Without wisdom we can&apos;t even tell if education is real or not,</p>
  <p>...the mark of a real education are real results.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Without wisdom we can&apos;t tell what real results even are,</p>
  <p>without wisdom we begin repeating old mistakes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>People say fake news - nope,</p>
  <p>but it is actually the fake education...</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Real education, helps a person become Wise and Noble,</p>
  <p>Triumphant, Successful, Strong, Unbreakable.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>In the real world no one ever celebrates graduation,</p>
  <p>because Real Education is about a Dignified, Realistic Success.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>If all students get is a Diploma and a Laboratory,</p>
  <p>or even Debt and a job they didn&apos;t need a University for.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is just a waste of time,</p>
  <p>and time is priceless.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The central component of Real Education is Joy,</p>
  <p>and satisfaction, and a sense of progression, and the undoing of the threat of poverty.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But without wisdom, it is hard to define poverty,</p>
  <p>or satisfaction, or even what joy is supposed to mean in context of education.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Without wisdom, we are easily tricked that memorization has something to do with education,</p>
  <p>we are easily tricked that confusion is just us not being good enough.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Memorization, is a cheap trick used by worthless teachers,</p>
  <p>to pretend that they are doing something.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And by memorizing you make them appear legitimate,</p>
  <p>you make them produce grades, and appear as teachers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And that confusion is there because their lectures make no sense,</p>
  <p>the text books probably don&apos;t make much sense either.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>There is no conspiracy,</p>
  <p>it is just people trying to fake it until they make it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Many do have lessons they could teach you,</p>
  <p>and just as many will keep them to themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Just to appear smarter someday, or just out of spite,</p>
  <p>&quot;Why should I tell them, it is not in the text book&quot;.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Lack of wisdom will keep a teacher, childlike,</p>
  <p>keep them thinking &quot;this is just a job&quot;, &quot;it is us versus them&quot;,</p>
  <p>and that usual &quot;I hate them&quot;, or &quot;hate my job&quot;.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>There are good teachers out there,</p>
  <p>but for all their goodness,</p>
  <p>they know deep down in their hearts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>That it is easier for you to learn on your own adventures,</p>
  <p>Then for them to try to help you understand what they know.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Learning is very intimate, and teaching what one knows is taking that intimacy,</p>
  <p>and trying to reshape it for strangers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Almost by definition this takes away all the passion,</p>
  <p>all the value of the lessons.</p>

  <p>Good Teacher,</p>
  <p>may just be an Oxymoron.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is your life, it must be your own path of discovery and self betterment,</p>
  <p>no one can help you through this.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Learning languages, is something we do naturally,</p>
  <p>not by memorizing but by becoming submerged in the language; by actually needing it for survival.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>If you want to learn French,</p>
  <p>head for the Colonies, inhale the language, don&apos;t memorize it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Learning mathematics, is similar, you don&apos;t do it by memorization,</p>
  <p>in Real Mathematics same symbols mean different things based on context and author.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>To learn Math, you start in the beginning,</p>
  <p>and slowly trace its development across Empires and centuries.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Whatever it is You Have To Love It,</p>
  <p>can you imagine loving every mathematician?</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Because that&apos;s what it takes to learn Math for real,</p>
  <p>or Physics, or Chemistry, or Biology, or Astrophysics.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Now imagine trying to teach a stranger,</p>
  <p>what you have learned, but without the love that you have personally felt for it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Oxymoron.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>Being good at Biology, Dancing, Medicine, Trail Running, Math, Electronics, Art, Computers, Music,</p>
  <p>still means little.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We get good at things we like,</p>
  <p>it is not a big deal to be good at something.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

<div class="section">
  <p>Being Wise, is a Big Deal,</p>
  <p>being able to Authentically and Nobly navigate live in a Dignified Fashion.</p>

  <p>With wisdom, we can figure out how the world works,</p>
  <p>the World is not a Mechanical Machine, now will it ever become a Political One,</p>
  <p>it is a Conundrum of Human Conditions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>All else must yield,</p>
  <p>it must.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It must,</p>
  <p>until you are touching the fabric of the future with your very own fingertips.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Until,</p>
  <p>you feel like a hero.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Until it is your voice, and your soul, and heart, and your works,</p>
  <p>and your strength.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>That make him, rise,</p>
  <p>with certainty of knowing, you are correct.</p>

  <p>Tired old man,</p>
  <p>who has seen everything and heard every lie.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>He&apos;s been a District Judge for more than he can remember,</p>
  <p>but he has heard every world yo said.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And the moment you mentioned,</p>
  <p>that it is Human Rights Day, he groaned.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And he stood downstairs,</p>
  <p>keeping his hands warm with a cup of coffee.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And he stood there much longer than you could,</p>
  <p>and it marked the end of his career.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But he never forgot your words,</p>
  <p>because your words were filled with wisdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Because you searched for it,</p>
  <p>because you fought for it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Because you were courageous,</p>
  <p>it all became crystal clear in your mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And more than moving a single judge,</p>
  <p>you will grow to move a generation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Grow to renew the search for meaning,</p>
  <p>the Love of Wisdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You moved mountains,</p>
  <p>you gave speeches long past your retirement.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>As the cities of the future grew,</p>
  <p>and as you grew.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And the life of wisdom made it so,</p>
  <p>that your name and the symbols it stood for earned permanence in Human History.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Wisdom, is your right,</p>
  <p>it is your first fight,</p>
  <p>it is your greatest might.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Rise my friend,</p>
  <p>rise to no end,</p>
  <p>the world needs you to set the trend.</p>
