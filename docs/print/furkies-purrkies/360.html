    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The Lighthouse</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I pulled up to the gate at Ludington State Park,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it made no sense to get to the hiking sites this late, and I didn't want a camper spot, I grabbed a tent site.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I had to show the woman at the booth my Raccoon Drawings,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">she loved them, and I think I had a deer in there too.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I quickly explained to her,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you need a cheap office projector, then use a photo editing program to help you find edges, and mid tones, and trace them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I drove in circles and circles, and some crazy fog I half remember,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and finally found the tent sites, way, way, way down the road.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I setup my first, overpriced, extra light tent, and started the fire,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I had my leather jacket on, it was cold in the evening.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I was probably listening to "The Story of Philosophy" by Durant,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you have to listen to it dozens of times.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There was a family camping behind me, their boy played a guitar,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">how do they do that I wondered.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They made a couple of trips for fire wood,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and we chatted a little.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I told the mom that it is really important that her boy listens to audio books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I showed her my iPod, and how you scroll the wheel to bring up the audio books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">She asked if this is what I do,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and then pointed at my car to change the subject.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"yeah" - I said,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">simply.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I waived goodbye, and got into my tent,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">probably fell asleep to A Short History of Nearly Everything, Bryson is a kindred spirit.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I woke up, packed and left early in the morning,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">before the family could talk to me again.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I am not sure if she waited until Christmas with buying the iPod for her boy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think not.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are too many books to be read,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">she set him up right after they got back, yeah she did.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I probably drove to Nordhouse for a few days,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for a change of scenery.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I don't know why people judge me to be a Yellow Buttercup Pansy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a month after the three days that I planned to stay.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I ran into another mini-hiker who recognized from the parking lot the month before,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this was on THAT steep hill in the middle of Arrowhead Trail.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">He was surprised to see me in the wilder-beast version,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with three or four fanny packs, a huge and well warn Bushcraft KA-BAR, and a dank superman shirt.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"Dood?" - He Said,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to express his surprise that I also stayed there forever.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I drove my heavy walking log into the ground and pronounced:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Though shalt pass", for that was about all the conversation I cared to have, I was listening to Paul Strathern's Philosophy in 90 Minutes series, it is good refresher.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Anyway, It was three times the conversation that he cared to have,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but it was still kind of sad, it meant that the woods were crowded now.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I drove back home, but I didn't take the stuff out of the car,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and I really appreciated the sand being everywhere, I like beach sand.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I drove back in a couple of months, I showed the lady at the booth, some more drawings,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">she asked me not to stop being an amazing artist, bless her heart.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This time I unpacked over a the hiking sites,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think I was re-listening to A Walk in the Woods by Bryson.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Whichever book has that damn paragraph about <span>that owl<sup>[1]</sup></span> swooping down,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and freeing a man of his scalp, thinking it is a fury creature, an easy mistake to make when you fly, apparently.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Gosh, squeaking with that water pump,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with the smell of my camp fire, the lake right over the dune Seth Shostack's "Search for Intelligent Life in Space" lectures playing and a nice sunset a moment before was very relaxing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In the morning I went to search for that shipwreck site, a man with a troop of cub-scouts walked up,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and mumbled something, but I couldn't look away from his forehead - I was confused about what I was looking at.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Then he explained with a heavy heart, that the perfect sideways D on his forehead,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is from his baseball cap that he had on backwards, I nodded carefully.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But, I didn't have a poker face back them, it is a recent talent,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there is nothing I can do to remember what he was asking, but I am pretty sure I was listening to either Robinson Crusoe.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Shortly thereafter, I climbed up the dune,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">put my hands on my hips and proclaimed, "it is time to go see what that little lighthouse is all about".</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I put on "The Science of Superheroes", hooked my shoes to my day-pack,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and slowly begun walking the beach making plenty of stops for snacks.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It turned out there was a little apartment there,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and they rented it out to the person that worked there.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And they had a whole bunch of little knick&#xB7;knacks for sale,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I stared brainlessly at a postcard of the lighthouse I was in.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I don't know what conclusion I came to in regards to the post card was,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but it certainly didn't involve wishing to make it my own.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The sunset,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">was perfect that day, not a cloud in the sky.</div>
</div>
