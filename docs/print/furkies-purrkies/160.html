  <p>If you grant me, that growing up is more than mere aging,</p>
  <p>and that the other component is Intellectual Development.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And if we agree that we each start near zero,</p>
  <p>and carry on upwards eventually becoming unique and creating undiscovered paths.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And if we agree that this idea cannot be used to belittle people,</p>
  <p>it can only be used for growing up, and towards Humanity&apos;s Noblest goals.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Then,</p>
  <p>there is something you should know.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You can&apos;t speak to all people who are still developing on different heights and in different paths,</p>
  <p>not in the same language, and each unique height will carry unique concepts that can&apos;t translate.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>While we share a lot,</p>
  <p>we don&apos;t share enough to communicate in ways that help us converge towards Wisdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>There cannot be a single language with shared deeply held beliefs,</p>
  <p>on subjects that relate to progressing forward or upward.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Each,</p>
  <p>must learn to translate, interpret and understand the other.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The speakers who who speak only on their own intellectual level,</p>
  <p>and from within their own culture are not enough to help the world grow.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Nor will there ever be a single mountain peak where we all converge,</p>
  <p>there can only be a certain height that will help cultures understand each other.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But, we do share the act of rising up, of growing up towards Wisdom,</p>
  <p>of standing in relentless pursuits of excellence.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And,</p>
  <p>of helping each other so that we may grow in Peace.</p>
