      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">3,900 Tigers</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No one person can save the world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we have to take turns because of how exhausting that is.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No one person can speak to the whole world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the world is too complex and our voice and message will become too scattered.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We just need to keep speaking until the message of leaving bad ideas behind becomes less and less blurry.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our problem is not so dissimilar</div>
  <div class="paragraph">from the problem of a victim of a cult.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our problem works on the same principle,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">limited knowledge, limits our awareness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">limited awareness constricts us to a subset of reality.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A fine example of constricted reality,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are dark or medieval ages.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Five hundred years ago Human Beings were just as intelligent as we are,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they simply knew less, were aware of less.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The culture and popular beliefs were rooted, in less.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Another example is raising a child,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with the genetics of someone from 10,000 years ago; today.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Growing up today would make them, just an average person,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they would not wish to take a bite out of a Woolly Mammoth,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or hope to own a Giant Ground Sloth, not anymore than we do.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They'd appreciate the iPhone, in form of the model they appreciate the most,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and had they been made aware that they are of the Ice Age,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they'd sweetly and jokingly name their kitty cat, Scrat.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our knowledge and the culture we grow up in, is extremely influential,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it decides how we develop, who we become, and what we recognize as reality.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A child born a couple of hundred years for now,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will struggle to understand our ignorance towards climate change.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In the schools of tomorrow, they will learn that we were victims,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">of broken educational systems, and cultures that didn't encourage pursuit of Wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To put it simply, some things sneak into us based on the level of our knowledge,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the height of development of the culture we are born into.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So are we really?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Geniuses.</div>
  <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
    <div class="paragraph">This is very important, it is a very important single word answer,</div>
    <div class="paragraph">to a very important question, that has great impact on the future of humanity.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
    <div class="paragraph">We are Geniuses.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
    <div class="paragraph">You know that man that is always wearing old clothes,</div>
    <div class="paragraph">and kind of works in a corner, and acts a little odd.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
    <div class="paragraph">He is also a genius.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
    <div class="paragraph">He is dying from loneliness, his mind is warped from ages of overwork,</div>
    <div class="paragraph">he can't really connect with people anymore because he has been feeling like an outsider for too many years,</div>
    <div class="paragraph">he found comfort in his corner, where he is safe and where his life is simple.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
    <div class="paragraph">But, should a chain of events push him,</div>
    <div class="paragraph">he will shed the patina of isolation, he will force himself to inherit modern culture and lifetimes from books,</div>
    <div class="paragraph">and genius will return, it will be fresh, raw, reignited, he may for a moment become the wisest being on earth.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
    <div class="paragraph">That's what genius is,</div>
    <div class="paragraph">a combination of unbreakability, and intellectual infinity.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
    <br>
  </div>
  <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
    <div class="paragraph">In more general terms,</div>
  </div>
  <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
    <div class="paragraph">We are a very odd Form of Life compared to all the other animals on Earth,</div>
    <div class="paragraph">we are self aware, and we are able to evaluate, and adjust, we are self enabling.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
    Ayn wrote,
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph">"If a drought strikes them, animals perish - man builds irrigation canals;</div>
      <div class="paragraph">if a flood strikes them, animals perish - man builds dams;</div>
      <div class="paragraph">if a carnivorous pack attacks them, animals perish - man writes the Constitution of the United States."</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph">We are struck by a culture that does not fully represent reality,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">but we will not jump from the cliff, we will not merely age - business as usual.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph">We will learn, we will teach ourselves to become genius,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">the easy-peasy way, by going on long adventures with a bunch of wise non-fiction books.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph">When our planet comes under attack, it will not perish,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">for it holds a species of animal that can perceive it self, alter, and rise to heights unseen.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph">All it takes,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">is for us to notice, that something is wrong.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <br>
    </div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph">Perhaps, taking it easy, would be OK,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">if you were not capable, of becoming a Great Being.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">if you were not a Genius, and a Powerful Thinker.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph">If you were unable to rise, to Inspire Generations,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">to save the Planet for all the Children yet to be born,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">and to repair schools so that they help humanity progress.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph">But ultimately taking it easy, can't be OK,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">because that would disappoint the one person that truly does have all the authority over you,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">that you really do not want to disappoint, in any way.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph">Your Elder Self...</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph">Your elder self, will be incredibly disappointed in you,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">if you fail to quickly shed all the stupid things sneaked into you by mis-education and questionable culture.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph">Your elder self, will be incredibly disappointed in you,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">if you fail to learn to unfold your wings as a genius, and an intellectual.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph">Your elder self, will be incredibly disappointed in you,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">if you fail to rise out of loneliness and isolation.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph">Your elder self, will be seriously pissed off,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">if you mess this up.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph">Your elder self will know exactly who you could have become,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">and where you made the wrong decisions that prevented you from becoming the person that they wish to be.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <br>
    </div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph">My Friends,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">I wish there was more I could to to help you believe that you are each a genius.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph">But I can only give you the books.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph">I can't put the ear-buds in your ears and press play,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">because to hear the books you have to slow down in life,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">you have to begin questioning the things that were driving you,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">and you have to become ready to listen,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">and by that time you can press play on your own.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph">A genius is not an intellectual anomaly,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">even Savants spend years mastering their tricks.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph">We are all capable of gaining Powerful Intelligence,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">and we don't need schools for that,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">just a mountain of down to earth books made heavy with lifetimes of wisdom.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph">You don't need to memorize Mathematical Formulas,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">and the last place you want to learn about Biology, is Biology.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph">What you need is stories that teach you about the reasons behind the invention of mathematics,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">and and an adventure where you re-invent mathematics from scratch, with the fantastic and magical ability to look some stuff up along the way.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph">You don't need to learn about the powerhouse of the cell,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">you need to begin with Stromatolites, Panspermia, Evolution and Astrobiology.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Mitochondria used to be a separate organism, what an adventure to follow, what an honor to make new discoveries on that path.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <br>
    </div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph">My Friends,</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph">You must begin your education by pushing everything that interferes with your Natural Genius away,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">even if it is the city you live in, or school you are forced to go to.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph">And you must begin your life, knowing that you are a Powerful Genius,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">in dire need for more books and audio books that will fuel your Wisdom.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph">As I write this,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">there are only 3,900 tigers left.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph">Please, believe in your genius, and grow, my friend,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">it is not just the tigers that need help,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">the task at hand if far greater.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph">With ten million people in cages around the word,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">we have to help children and students of today,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">out of poverty, and towards real education,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">so that they may have a chance at a fair start in life.</div>
