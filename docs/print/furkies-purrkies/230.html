  <p>Schools and Teachers, Universities, Colleges, and Professors, and even Politicians,</p>
  <p>all had an amazing opportunity to enable the current generations with Real Education.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>They will keep saying that they are working on it, and that they love students,</p>
  <p>but then they will get confused and put politics first, creating that Hollow Feeling again.</p>

  <p>You know what, they have ran out of time,</p>
  <p>this is a big century for Human Kind.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>We started out on the wrong foot,</p>
  <p>we doubled the total of fossil fuel emissions in the last 25 years.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>When Al Gore was working on his book,</p>
  <p>he was writing in a world that had half the atmospheric emission we do.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You see, we are the leaders now, the intellectuals, the poets, the artists,</p>
  <p>the people who failed to stop that doubling have retired or passed away.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>If we were to ask them what they did it,</p>
  <p>they could only say &quot;How was I supposed to know?&quot;</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>No blame, no accountability,</p>
  <p>the change is so slow that the men who were destroying the world are gone.</p>

  <p>The next 80 years is really important,</p>
  <p>we can&apos;t afford to test if perhaps fake education will work out for us if we cram.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It maybe time, to temporarily push away from the promise of a diploma and a job,</p>
  <p>and catch up with what has been going on in the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Reading and listening to real books is important,</p>
  <p>taking responsibility for our own education, is very important.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You get to pick your Audio Books, your own Lecture Videos,</p>
  <p>watch Documentaries about Climate and Nature, maybe Politics.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Keep a journal, do a book review,</p>
  <p>for every Audio Book and Documentary you like.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And get out there, go camping, and adventuring.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Maybe even section hike the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Trail">Appalachian Trail</a>, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Crest_Trail">Pacific Crest Trail</a>,</p>
  <p>or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago">El Camino de Santiago</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kom%E2%80%93Emine">Kom-Emine</a>, with your friends and parents.</p>

  <p>Let the sunrise tell you when it is time to study,</p>
  <p>let the sunset help you to sleep.</p>

  <p>A lot that was lost in translation during standardized education,</p>
  <p>can be pretty quickly regained, with top non-fiction, as long as you make room for it.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>So, let us consider taking a year off when we feel ready for books,</p>
  <p>maybe before college, or before we transfer to a university.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The journal and corresponding hiking videos or book reviews,</p>
  <p>will provide plenty of evidence that it was not a year that was merely lost.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It seems that our Elder Selves will not hold falling in love with books against us,</p>
  <p>to the contrary, this maybe one of those things that they wish for.</p>
