    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Schools and Teachers, Universities, Colleges, and Professors, and even Politicians,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">all had an amazing opportunity to enable the current generations with Real Education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They will keep saying that they are working on it, and that they love students,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but then they will get confused and put politics first, creating that Hollow Feeling again.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You know what, they have ran out of time,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this is a big century for Human Kind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We started out on the wrong foot,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we doubled the total of fossil fuel emissions in the last 25 years.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When Al Gore was working on his book,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">he was writing in a world that had half the atmospheric emission we do.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You see, we are the leaders now, the intellectuals, the poets, the artists,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the people who failed to stop that doubling have retired or passed away.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If we were to ask them what they did it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they could only say "How was I supposed to know?"</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No blame, no accountability,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the change is so slow that the men who were destroying the world are gone.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The next 80 years is really important,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we can't afford to test if perhaps fake education will work out for us if we cram.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It maybe time, to temporarily push away from the promise of a diploma and a job,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and catch up with what has been going on in the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Reading and listening to real books is important,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">taking responsibility for our own education, is very important.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You get to pick your Audio Books, your own Lecture Videos,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">watch Documentaries about Climate and Nature, maybe Politics.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Keep a journal, do a book review,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for every Audio Book and Documentary you like.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And get out there, go camping, and adventuring.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Maybe even section hike the <span>Appalachian Trail<sup>[1]</sup></span>, or the <span>Pacific Crest Trail<sup>[2]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or <span>El Camino de Santiago<sup>[3]</sup></span> and <span>Kom-Emine<sup>[4]</sup></span>, with your friends and parents.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let the sunrise tell you when it is time to study,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">let the sunset help you to sleep.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A lot that was lost in translation during standardized education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">can be pretty quickly regained, with top non-fiction, as long as you make room for it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So, let us consider taking a year off when we feel ready for books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">maybe before college, or before we transfer to a university.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The journal and corresponding hiking videos or book reviews,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will provide plenty of evidence that it was not a year that was merely lost.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It seems that our Elder Selves will not hold falling in love with books against us,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to the contrary, this maybe one of those things that they wish for.</div>
