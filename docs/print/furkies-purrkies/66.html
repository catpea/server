  <p>We are not robots, to be taught,</p>
  <p>we are humans powered by inventive and original thought.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>This is why life has no instruction book,</p>
  <p>if it did, it could only ever tell us where to look.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>For the sake of this poem,</p>
  <p>let us image that this book does, exist.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Here is how I imagine it would read,</p>
  <p>and let me start with the opening creed:</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>- If someone is attacking you call for help, until it comes.</p>
  <p>- If school is treating you unfairly, go hang out with the Principal.</p>
  <p>- You need to build your Content of Character.</p>
  <p>- Your Body of Wisdom is a Key To Happiness.</p>
  <p>- You Must Grow All The Way Up.</p>
  <p>- You are to Become a Great Being.</p>
  <p>- You Are Beautiful, You Were Beautiful All Along.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It would point to learn from The Greats</p>
  <p>as they managed to lift impossible weights.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It would also say that we are delicate,</p>
  <p>and our minds are extremely intricate.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It would add, Hey!</p>
  <p>You can not grow up in places that weigh.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You have to find you own place in the world,</p>
  <p>and you have to quit doing what you are told.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Above all it would state,</p>
  <p>that you are Free,</p>
  <p>and Full of Beauty.</p>
  <p>and searching for Wisdom is your duty.</p>
</div></div>
         </div>
       </div>
     </div>
