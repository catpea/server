    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The Conjecture</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It started Christmas 2020, the world was already in trouble;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the conjecture in a sentence was this:</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"What can be corrupted will be corrupted, and there are no fully operational public institutions anywhere",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is too easy for bad people to, not just subvert, but erase lifetimes of hard work and dedication.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is commonly known as corruption, but that didn't matter to them,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because they were not attempting to fix things, they had an idea how to replace everything.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And by everything,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they meant institutions all around the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They were going to begin in the beginning, Henry Ford once said,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.",</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The idea was that if they went to the Courts, Police or Schools,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they would have wanted the wrong things, that would only invite more problems.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Initially nobody knew how immune to corruption the thing was going to be,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but there was a way to find out.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The thing was a game, it was meant to be a simulation of a city,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it was a simple program that used simple web design principles to simulate a city.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The non playable characters, were little bots that would interact with the player,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the bots were crafted to simulate officials, and they interacted with web pages the way a user would.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So part of the reason why the programming was so simple,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is that bots needed a simple way to pretend to be humans.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When everything went online players would sign up to take over for the bots,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and some of the initial testing was about corrupting the institutions of the city.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The thinking was that, if it was not possible for players to corrupt an institution,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then the program could replace all the management software of a real city.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To their surprise there was a number of cities that were willing to participate in the trials,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it took them a better part of a decade to get everything going, but the initial trials worked.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They knew that they became famous,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when the UN wouldn't stop calling.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It worked because they kept insisting on simplicity,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they kept using bots, and corruption simulation teams for decades.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The program was adopted by almost all the cities of the world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">about 10,000 running copies.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What was fascinating about this,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is that it was still played as a game.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There was a Virtual Cyberpunk City,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that everyone went to for internet news.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The program relies on plain HTTP, REST, and HTML</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and to make it operate well on $30 Android Tablets it uses little client-side scripting.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is a Virtual City at heart,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but when players start mapping out real homes, and roads, and the citizens join in,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it inflates to become a virtual representation of a real city.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">People can vote in elections, and there is no real threat of corruption here,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because their voting history is under their profile.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Elections, that was one of the things that got a huge upgrade in many of the cities around the world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">some cities just vote on ideas that need to get done, they don't vote on representatives anymore.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The program as a whole,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">eliminated the need for representatives.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">People vote on issues that need immediate attention,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and those are the first issues that get solved.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Two amazing things emerged from within the program,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">schools begun working for the students by providing them with Audio Books, Lectures, and Chat (that's what the teachers are called),</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the trail of programs that students select over the course of their teenage years actually becomes their resume.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Schools started working,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it was Rebirth and Enlightenment of both the citizens and the cities.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The second,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">people could work on tasks logged by the users of the program.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Some tasks like taking care of public gardens could result in users getting monthly tips from their community,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">people loved being able to give the lady down the street $8/mo. for making sure all the flower beds were taken care of,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the lady next door was often bringing in $3,200 per month for something that she would do anyway, people loved her.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Other tasks like road work, could get a bounty, bounties basically ensured that all the road work was done,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">any competent company could claim a task and grab the bounty for a pothole.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">People would setup an tiny Limited Liability Company and stock up on compatible materials, and wait for roadwork tasks,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there were no more delays to get things done, and these bounties could grow fast.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All this was tested in the games before cities adopted the program,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so everyone knew what they were getting, and the stuff just worked.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There was an interesting phenomenon where automated programs would actually stay in place of people,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">one of the most well know instances dealt with the prison population, in a small Swiss city.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The entire process was often ran by bots,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">city was able to vote on presets, this eliminated the need for many local Judges.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In this particular instance all the folks who got into fights,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">were automatically given community service, duration of which would increase with each repeated offense under the same category,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the community service program was actually a well paying program, the users didn't want people to go to jail,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they wanted the troublemakers to get a job.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Words like felon and criminal were not used, people in the community had access to their entire education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they could see into hearts and souls of these users, the books, pursuits, and curiosities of their teenage years were right there.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Psychologists were able to build up a new spectrum disorder, that emerged from stress, loss, fear, isolation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The Swiss town actually ended up closing most of it's prisons.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In America, a similar system of automated programs resulted in a lot of convictions being overturned.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">
    This was a prison management system where the inmates were able to present their case in a way that the citizens would understand from a more humane perspective,</div>
  again the entire past of that person was right there, tragedies and loss, and stress would be followed by more misfortune, deteriorating mental condition, desperate self medication
  to get back to a thinking state, and what was once called a Felon or Criminal, once again became a Human, a Brother, a Son, a Daughter, a Mother.<div class="paragraph"></div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Prison population dropped.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Nobody called this program a game,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it was always meant to change the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The cities were always connected together to form a larger Global Metropolis,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">originally it helped people with jobs, as users could tell where they could find tasks that fit them best,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But now, decades after the initial release;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the program begun uniting the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">War, for one became unthinkable,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as people could see how the well being of even one city affected all the others.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There was no such thing as not having a job,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the cities always needed help with countless tasks.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Corruption had nowhere to hide, the crooked politicians had nowhere to hide,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">national borders made little economic sense, and Climate Change stopped being an issue by 2030.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Not that they cared for rewards, but The Women behind the program,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the original programmers, received Purple Hearts and multiple Nobel Peace Prizes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What they did love was the fact that the United Nations regained a certain vitality,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">something that they discovered was once lost in the translation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Every city now has a sculpture to honor them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Many of their sculptures bear the words they uttered so many times during the initial development, "Faster Horses".</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In closing, the conjecture was true.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In the haste of life, people, often out of desperation, will try to meet goals by exploiting systems without active countermeasures.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The only system that can resist corruption and exploitation, is one designed from ground up to resist it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">
  </div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It takes a computer to create a a corruption-resistant scaffold around the matters of a city.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Where there is no room for stretching rules, the participants can only be encouraged to take the correct paths.</div>
