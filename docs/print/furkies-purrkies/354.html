      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Exceptional Ability As A Tool For Thinking</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The term Exceptional Ability probably originated,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in a unique process required for a US Green Card.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">More recently it has been used by the CEO of a large company,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to describe an alternative to a college diploma.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Personally, I use it as a way to show that High School and College,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are not what they seem to be,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And the way I want _you_ to think about it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is, as a private, and personal tool for self evaluation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I don't think we all need to think about having exceptional abilities,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think we all have that power within, and ordinary I would say most of us have better things to do.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But, I think world's schools need great repairs,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and until they begin working properly we need a tool for thinking, a kind of a compass, and this notion of Exceptional Ability can guide our self education efforts.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I want you to ask: "Is High School providing me with Exceptional Ability?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Is College providing me with Exceptional Ability?".</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I want you to resist thinking about High School as means,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to College, Med School, and University, which then will make your dreams come true.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We need to,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">stay on the ground.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you are already worried, that you will ruin your life by not doing what everyone else is doing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">start preparing for Thru-hiking the Appalachian and Pacific Crest Trails, and begin training for Marathons, and Western States 100.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Exceptional ability, by definition, means that there is nobody else like you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">graduating from a University may actually show that your education is not exceptional.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is not my intent to encourage everyone to think in terms of exceptional abilities,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that is just as dumb as using the word genius to describe one self.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My intent is to help people reach their golden age with fewer regrets,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we have such powerful imaginations, and such excellent patience that we are each a writer, a leader, an inventor, an inspiration.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Standardized education has a tendency to discourage exceptional abilities,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because, by definition, they are unique and can't be standardized or graded.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is a teacher, and leader in all of us,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and some people enjoy teaching and leading so much that they become Intellectual Leaders for the whole world, in a way, World's True Leaders.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The True Leaders of the world, are those who change lives for better,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">their books very frequently earn a permanent place in Human History, and help the world grow.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They don't want to be presidents or prime ministers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and they are held in such great esteem that nobody really cares to ask them to focus on anything in particular.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The True Leaders of Humanity, do the things that they are good at, that are meaningful to them,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and then they share, be it by writing a book, or by invitation to speak.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Some people that take to working on their Exceptional Abilities,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">often do go on to become these Leaders Without Borders.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One must wonder, how many are lost to High School,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or College and University.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Don't worry about ever needing to present proof of exceptional ability,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">whatever job wants just the proof, is probably not worth your time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When you enter the path of helping the world grow a little bit,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to change lives for the better, to bring enlightenment where lies caked together to create darkness, your priories will shift a little bit.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is where Western States, and the Pacific Crest and Appalachian Trails come in handy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">adventure gives you just about enough room, to begin weaving your next thought.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Above all, Exceptional Ability is your private self-measuring stick,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">perhaps it is best used by your elder self, in terms of imagining yourself 50 years in the future and trying to figure out what your regrets maybe at that time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Imagining your Elder Self telling you whether or not you have Exceptional Ability is a fun exercise,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">no one knows your better then your wisest self.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It will take a while to learn how to make use of this tool for thinking properly,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but it takes little to begin asking: "Am I on my way towards exception abilities, or not."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is a tool for your own self, it cannot be used by anybody else but you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in deed, people that really care about you, don't need proof to know that you are exceptional.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is a tool for our inner-selves, to make progress forward, and in such a way, that our elder selves won't be sitting around disappointed,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that they blew what turned out to be the only opportunity at delving a magnificently scalding Valedictorian speech that ended up igniting a Revolution In Education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is a tool to keep our path of self education at a consistent incline,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so that we can be sure that come our golden age we will have all the wisdom we need.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even those of us who don't care to ponder self education and pursuits of Exceptional Abilities,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">eventually do develop them so as long as they further their wisdom to no end.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If I had to describe what proof of exceptional ability, or breathtaking wisdom, looks like,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I'd say it comes in the shape of a book, a book that changes lives for better.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If it was a science book,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it would probably be an accessible popular science book inviting the whole world to learn along with an inspirational narrative.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Most often it is probably some kind of Autobiographical Journal, maybe a Journal of Self Education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or Poetry, or a heavy book full of Artworks and ideas behind them, or tutorials.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If the figure in Gladwell's Outliers is anything to go by,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then it probably takes ten years to create, and maybe another five to write down.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think of a book, because books are great at creating descriptions,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">though a person's work may revolve around fixing education, it would almost certainly be a book or an audio book, that would tell the story.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Finally, can proof of exceptional ability be used as a substitute for a College Diploma,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think so, if the management appreciates your book, they will appreciate your presence as well.</div>
