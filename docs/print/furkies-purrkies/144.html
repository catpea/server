    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Greatness of Soul, Heart, and Mind</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It has been happening slowly for a hundred years,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">even though people are not taught to become Great Beings.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Mistakes, especially the ones that make us feel foolish,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">open out minds for rapid self education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It used to be harder to learn,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">now we have Audiobooks and video lectures.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is a very big difference between finding Thoreau's Walden,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and having a Writer or a Professor take you on a tour of modern philosophy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think the ability to pause a lecture or an audio book is amazing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I paused as often to stop and think as I used to pause to cry.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My Dear Friends,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I speak of Great Beings,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because I was moved, by Great Beings.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And all my Heart and Love tells me,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that the most important lesson I can share with You,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Is that for all the goodness You do;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You must become, a Great Being too.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I used to drive around listening to Audiobooks,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I went down to Florida during Michigan Winter.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I set my Audio Books aside, and turned on the radio for a bit,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I only heard two words, it was the third Monday of January.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"Content of Character"</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I turned the radio down, goodness, once my eyes dried,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I knew that the Soul had no limit, and that it was meant to hold Wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That's how Philosophers were growing in Greatness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Knowledge begot Wisdom, and Wisdom begot Greatness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Martin Luther King Jr. is his name and it will never be forgotten,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">his words are a permanent invitation to Greatness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I enjoyed practicing driving on North Territorial Road between Canton and Ann Arbor,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and on a late Autumn evening with trees dressed in beautiful colors a lecture was playing in the background.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All of a sudden my mind snapped to attention,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">my mind became as sharp as a razor blade, and I could not believe the gravity and beauty of what I was hearing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to front only the essential facts of life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and see if I could not learn what it had to teach,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I did not wish to live what was not life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">unless it was quite necessary.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to cut a broad swath and shave close,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms..."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I hit the pause button on my Audio Player,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I had tears in my eyes but didn't cry.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Ever since that one fun time when we watched Ferris Bueller's Day Off in my first year of Highschool,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as part of learning English and good film making, I remembered:</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Ferris Bueller saying "Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was as cautions as a cat not to let a day go by withut doing something important.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And now I heard a world celebrated Philosopher say the same,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in a book from 1850, a book written by a man that shared some of his strength with Mahatma Gandhi.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A man I lovingly call Henry,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think of him as my friend in time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Henry David Thoreau is a friend to us all,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">he used to think about us, about making life better for us, the future generations.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I was at Ambrosia in Ann Arbor,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Though I wasn't a regular, I spent a lot of time there when it was empty and I could be alone later at night.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I started keeping a folder of ideas and poems,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I've noticed really beautiful people going to the sports bar next door.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I tried to ignore the song that was playing as it was frightening me,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the lyrics rang "Where'd you get your body from, I got it from my moma."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A couple of regulars gathered by and inquired about my paperwork,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and I thought it was prime time, to tell them word for word.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I begun by reading Kosmos by Walt Whitman,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I remember finishing with such a flourish that one of my listeners staggered back.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Kosmos (Written in 1860 by Walt Whitman)</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Who includes diversity and is Nature,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who is the amplitude of the earth, and the coarseness and sexuality of the earth, and the great charity of the earth and the equilibrium also,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who has not look&#x2019;d forth from the windows the eyes for nothing, or whose brain held audience with messengers for nothing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who contains believers and disbelievers, who is the most majestic lover,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who holds duly his or her triune proportion of realism, spiritualism, and of the &#xE6;sthetic or intellectual,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who having consider&#x2019;d the body finds all its organs and parts good,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who, out of the theory of the earth and of his or her body understands by subtle analogies all other theories,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The theory of a city, a poem, and of the large politics of these States;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who believes not only in our globe with its sun and moon, but in other globes with their suns and moons,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who, constructing the house of himself or herself, not for a day but for all time, sees races, eras, dates, generations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The past, the future, dwelling there, like space, inseparable together.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I actually I had to stop the person from leaving,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"One more" - I asked, nay commanded, demanded, just to share Ayn's Vision of John Galt, and I begun:</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"Your destroyers hold you by means of your endurance, your generosity, your innocence, your love</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the endurance that carries their burdens</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the generosity that responds to their cries of despair</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the innocence that is unable to conceive of their evil and gives them the benefit of every doubt, refusing to condemn them without understanding and incapable of understanding such motives as theirs</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the love, your love of life, which makes you believe that they are men and that they love it, too." (from John Galt's Speech from Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand)</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I remember I wasn't able to finish my listeners fidgeted and had to go,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I didn't belong in Ann Arbor, I didn't really belong at Ambrosia, the truth was I didn't belong anywhere anymore.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I remember someone asking me where I was from, what country;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and as I rolled up my poems getting ready to leave,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"I am a Citizen of the World." - I said without thinking anything of it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I remember sitting up one time feeling really alone,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think I was headed up to Ludington this time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And time came to listen to Viktor E. Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">bullies came after me when I was a chubby child.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One year sometime when I was 13 maybe,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the little me made the older me make a promise.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I was to return to that damn classrom in my imagination,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and sit right next to my younger self, and keep him company so that he is not scared anymore.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I kept that promise,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but from time to time I also visit Dr. Frankl, I sit by his bed to keep him company too.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is a very powerful description of Great Beings in his book,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is something that we should each remember.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">giving away their last piece of bread.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the last of the human freedoms -- to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The book I have read the most times is "A Short History of Nearly Everything" by Bill Bryson,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is a book that begins with an honest journey to find out more about the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is very helpful to realize that we don't know all the things we should know,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and not be ashamed of that, just simply look for some Audio Books on the subject.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I write this in 2020 in the middle of the Pandemic,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and there is a lot of misled people, people who got taken in by false information.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In my memory Carl Sagan in his "The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">mentions something similar on the subject of Aliens and UFOs.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">He says that there is more beauty and interesting things in the actual Science,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">than fantasizing stories of visiting aliens and flying saucers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When I was a teenager I was a huge fan of shows like the X-Files,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and I remember walking into a mighty New York Public Library to crack the case, once and fall all,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Nut instead falling in love with <span>Mokele-mbembe<sup>[1]</sup></span>, I recognized the creature from my first Science book "Wszech&#x15B;wiat &#x17C;ycie cz&#x142;owiek" published in 1955,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it was a Brontosaurus, and I instantly fell in love with the idea there there might be a few left in Rhodesia.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For the world to carry on becoming more and more United,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we have to become Great Lovers of Knowledge and take to Books and Audio Books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The treasures withing are unlike anything we have heard of in school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the books that we end up loving and carrying with us for the rest of our lives, make us better.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And there is never an end to learning for real,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">every few weeks a new book comes out that you didn't even know you were waiting for.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It becomes a source of Wisdom, or just sheer joy as the case is with Randall Munroe's</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My Dear Friends, I wish you the discovery of new poems, new quotes,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">new books and video lectures, authors you will love for live and then some.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And don't worry, the world is coming together, the borders are fading, and there is noting that can stop that,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Humanity is in the process of Unifying to become One Loving Family.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We can hasten this process by learning, acquiring more knowledge,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">preventing history's mistakes from repeating themselves.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The path to the future is found In Knowledge and Wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and aiming for Greatness of Soul, Heart, and Mind.</div>
