  <p>From the little seed of your notebook, your trusty pencil,</p>

  <p>If you choose to practice resignation, if you fall,</p>
  <p>the link of chain that holds the past and the future of Humanity will weaken.</p>

  <p>School is just the best all of the uneducated humanity at the time could agree on,</p>
  <p>it is our first best try, and it was a failure that in its misery will now serve us,</p>
  <p>as a source of wisdom for building the second generation of schools.</p>

  <p>This time everybody can see, that proper education is the best hope humanity has,</p>
  <p>this time we will know the price that an Miseducated Earth pays.</p>

  <p>People that made you feel unintelligent, made a mistake out of desperation,</p>
  <p>because they couldn&apos;t have know how to teach, because the idea of the classroom,</p>
  <p>and standardized education and testing is just an uninformed political fantasy,</p>
  <p>crafted for simple and convincing displays of progress, and easy reelection campaigns.</p>

  <p>School was invented as an experiment by Great Self Taught Beings,</p>
  <p>though it is broken, it still serves to keep the Global Level of Knowledge high enough,</p>
  <p>for us to communicate about leaving bad ideas behind, and which are worth keeping.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We know it will be based on the way the Self Taught learn,</p>
  <p>we know there will be no grades, just your brilliant path through the tree of knowledge.</p>

  <p>The new generation of schools will bring Humanity closer together,</p>

  <p>We used to think that school was an island,</p>

  <p>Let us begin by taking to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,</p>
  <p>and setting it as the Opening Chapter of the New Text Book,</p>
  <p>in recognition that school is directly responsible,</p>
  <p>for the future of Earth and all her Inhabitants.</p>

  <p>May the first lesson, of this first New Text Book,</p>
  <p>stand to describe how vulnerable we are to cultural indoctrination,</p>

  <p>May it serve as a cautionary tale,</p>
  <p>and as an inspiration to Leadership, clear thinking,</p>
  <p>and always choosing the harder right over the easier wrong.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>May all the countless chapters of this new book help each student,</p>
  <p>young or old to find their beginning and discover their unique path through Human Knowledge.</p>
