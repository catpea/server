    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are a great inventor, invention is something we do naturally,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but you need to detox from all the hustle and bustle of busy life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your private inventions usually build on something someone else did,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so social networks, websites, photography, and maybe art.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you just sit down with something that fascinates you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and play with it, you are bound to invent something new.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us start with a silly example,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You could create a custom phone ring service, where people yell names...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so when someone calls Alan, the phone actually <span>screams for him<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And here your invention would be about how your relate to voice artists, what tools you give them,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">would you also create an addition where the phone yells the name of the person that is calling.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Something more serious would be a social network that takes all your weekly posts,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and creates a part of a chapter in your memoir, here the users can order a paper hard copy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you could customize this idea by providing beautifully bound books that feature posts from many users,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and you may even simply rely on existing social networks.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Not all starting points require the internet,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or complexity for that matter.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do you know about <span>Spin Art<sup>[2]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if you could invent a personal touch, maybe something to do with 3D features, or thread,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">every Dentist's Office would feature your fantastic art, your signature, and website address,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and you could even publish a coffee book about your art.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For something less abstract consider building a <span>tilt-shift<sup>[3]</sup></span> photography service,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">where you get a little drone to fly up to get a giant's view, and take the most fascinating photos,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for weddings, real-estate, even newspaper articles.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For something more startling, you could start with <span>macro photography<sup>[4]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">now entering a realm that everyone can't help but to be fascinated with,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">enormous six foot canvas featuring tiny bugs.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You could even go deeper and do <span>Photomicrography<sup>[5]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and here you enter a world that very few people think about, some may even find your photos unbelievable,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this kind of work would get you featured in national galleries.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you don't like still photography, consider setting up cheap time laps cameras all over the place,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and then sell them as background video for speeches, or poetry, or add classical music and call it a new way to hear it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or call it the study of passage of time, and make a documentary about it, to get at your first Oscar.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Not all inventions need to make money or fame,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but all inventions must fascinate you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They have to call to your soul,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to your health, to your curiosity.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have thousands of ideas in your mind,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">slow down, get in touch with your Inventive Side,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and help the world become more beautiful.</div>
