  <p>You are a great inventor, invention is something we do naturally,</p>
  <p>but you need to detox from all the hustle and bustle of busy life.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Your private inventions usually build on something someone else did,</p>
  <p>so social networks, websites, photography, and maybe art.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>If you just sit down with something that fascinates you,</p>
  <p>and play with it, you are bound to invent something new.</p>
</div>

  <p>Let us start with a silly example,</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You could create a custom phone ring service, where people yell names...</p>
  <p>so when someone calls Alan, the phone actually <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPepCVepCg">screams for him</a>.</p>
  <p>And here your invention would be about how your relate to voice artists, what tools you give them,</p>
  <p>would you also create an addition where the phone yells the name of the person that is calling.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Something more serious would be a social network that takes all your weekly posts,</p>
  <p>and creates a part of a chapter in your memoir, here the users can order a paper hard copy,</p>
  <p>you could customize this idea by providing beautifully bound books that feature posts from many users,</p>
  <p>and you may even simply rely on existing social networks.</p>
</div>

  <p>Not all starting points require the internet,</p>
  <p>or complexity for that matter.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Do you know about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQKZYcf0bH8">Spin Art</a>,</p>
  <p>if you could invent a personal touch, maybe something to do with 3D features, or thread,</p>
  <p>every Dentist&apos;s Office would feature your fantastic art, your signature, and website address,</p>
  <p>and you could even publish a coffee book about your art.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>For something less abstract consider building a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpeUEK_5Tb0">tilt-shift</a> photography service,</p>
  <p>where you get a little drone to fly up to get a giant&apos;s view, and take the most fascinating photos,</p>
  <p>for weddings, real-estate, even newspaper articles.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>For something more startling, you could start with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV08rumiAnA">macro photography</a>,</p>
  <p>now entering a realm that everyone can&apos;t help but to be fascinated with,</p>
  <p>enormous six foot canvas featuring tiny bugs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You could even go deeper and do <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjQfsDe1Q0o">Photomicrography</a>,</p>
  <p>and here you enter a world that very few people think about, some may even find your photos unbelievable,</p>
  <p>this kind of work would get you featured in national galleries.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>If you don&apos;t like still photography, consider setting up cheap time laps cameras all over the place,</p>
  <p>and then sell them as background video for speeches, or poetry, or add classical music and call it a new way to hear it,</p>
  <p>or call it the study of passage of time, and make a documentary about it, to get at your first Oscar.</p>
</div>

  <p>Not all inventions need to make money or fame,</p>
  <p>but all inventions must fascinate you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>They have to call to your soul,</p>
  <p>to your health, to your curiosity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You have thousands of ideas in your mind,</p>
  <p>slow down, get in touch with your Inventive Side,</p>
  <p>and help the world become more beautiful.</p>
