      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The Journey To The Old End Of The I-275 Bicycle Trail</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Every one in a while I bicycle to the <span>south end<sup>[1]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and check if they did any work, and how it went.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I always find it old, and full, of bumps thorns and grass,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">no matter how hard I bicycle, there is never a way to pass.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I work up this morning, and said "It is time for another check!",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I got my gear together, and squirted sunblock all around on my neck.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And as soon as got too far to go back,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">my bicycle, creaked, and shuddered, and squeaked - and I was like "What the heck?"</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The noise came from the bottom where the pedals are,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and only the left pedal made noise thus far.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And the noise would not cease,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I had the tools but no grease.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So I said to my self in a deep tone "It is time for Field Repair!,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and although I have no grease, I will not despair.""</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">First, I checked the pockets of my new red pants, the short ones that I like,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but there was nothing there that could fix my bike.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So I looked to my day pack, and the solution sat right next to my bicycle lock,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I squeaked! "I do have grease, it is in my sun block!"</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So I squired some on the pedals and the connecting rod,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and though I admit the solution was a bit odd...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I was back on the road, riding smoothly and quietly like a pro,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">after all, I had places to go.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I made it to the southern edge, it was 15 miles away,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they still didn't fix anything, bumps and shrubs were blocking the way.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I took a photo to share with you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">just in case you were thinking about going or pushing through.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;"><img src="../../image/md-poetry-0108-end.jpg" alt="Path"></div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The <span>actual ancient end of the trail<sup>[2]</sup></span> is not that far away,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">about 2.6 miles south, but you are better off walking the rest of the way.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even better than following the ancient end, is to <span>go to the park<sup>[3]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and head for lake Erie, but make sure to leave early, so that you don't bicycle back after dark.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The trick to make it to the lake is to <span>turn right before<sup>[4]</sup></span> the Nature Center,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and head through Flat Rock, to <span>Maple Beach<sup>[5]</sup></span>, you don't have to pay to enter.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think of it as the real end to the trail,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">reaching it always make for a good tale.</div>
</div>
