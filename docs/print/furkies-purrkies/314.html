  <p>The best lecture is one that you prepare yourself,</p>
  <p>out of documentaries, internet videos, audio books, info-graphics and visualizations.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>Sometimes you get some hands on experience,</p>
  <p>like a Raspberry PI Kit, with a bread board and a bunch of sensors to learn UNIX and soldering, for example.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>Other times, it turns out that all your materials fit in a backpack, or a day-pack,</p>
  <p>so you add a loaf of bread, some trail mix and water, and you are off.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>Studying Astrophysics with all the greats as you hike to your camp site,</p>
  <p>where upon your arrival you set up camp on top of ancient dune and wait for the stars to come out.</p>

  <p>It is important to note, that falling asleep during your own lecture is amazing,</p>
  <p>when you wake up the Audio Book will still be playing, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Carl+Sagan" title="Carl Sagan">Carl</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Neil+deGrasse+Tyson" title="Neil deGrasse Tyson">Neil</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Seth+Shostak" title="Seth Shostak">Seth</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Alex+Filippenko" title="Alex Filippenko">Alex</a> will surely be describing something awesome.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>Rather than returning to the spot where you fell asleep,</p>
  <p>it is always better to just get to the end and keep re-listening the whole thing, until you can remember everything, and actually need a new audio book.</p>

  <p>Your own lectures, are much more authentic than anything a Professor can regurgitate out,</p>
  <p>real lectures don&apos;t end after 12 classes, they last a lifetime, and when you return to the same books, it is such a pleasure.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>The best advice I could give on the subject of lectures, is described with a single word:</p>
  <p>ADVENTURE.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>Even if you are getting into circuit design or electronics, all you need to do is get some solar powered gear and a butane soldering iron,</p>
  <p>then wire up a solar powered wireless network in a weather proof enclosure out the deepest part of the woods, and name it <a href="https://thecabininthewoods.fandom.com/wiki/The_Facility">The Facility</a>.</p>

  <p>Reply to all HTTP requests with a creative login page,</p>
  <p>what better way to learn UNIX then to have outrageous fun with it.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>Might as well learn a programming language while you&apos;re at it,</p>
  <p>how about creating a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD">MUD</a> with some snappy and convincing bots: &quot;Ballerina Dentata entered the chat, and started following you.&quot;</p>

  <p>It should a rule that we take our education onto the Nature Trails,</p>
  <p>or places that challenge you, even if all they challenge you with, is fun and useless foolishness.</p>

  <p>It won&apos;t take long before adventures become expeditions,</p>
  <p>detecting supernovae from some mountain peak, tracking melting glaciers and climate data, or even reliably counting lighting bugs.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>In school we tend to wait for a lecture to come to a resolution,</p>
  <p>but in real life, a lecture is allowed to become its true self, it becomes a breathtaking gateway to explore and conquer the unknown.</p>
