    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The Great Being</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To rise, to become strong, to grow and to break away and become more authentic,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is our first great responsibility, and our health.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">However, it does go against our nature as children,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we have a tendency not to look outside of the culture we are brought into.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Rite of Passage is about crossing that line,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the line between The Child That Follows, and The Adult That Leads.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The moment we can handle looking at ourselves and our culture,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">from the <strong>outside</strong> in, we begin crossing the line into adulthood.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One of the first few thoughts may be, "But what if I was born into a different religion?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">followed by, "What if I was not born into this economic class, into this poverty?".</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As these questions grow from asking about ourselves, to also including others,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they bring us insight into the greater Human Condition.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Bring us to the question of The Freedom of Will, of how much our Personality is Our Own,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">of internal decision making heavily influenced by external culture or placement.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As we grow we begin asking even greater questions about others,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Would the petty thief stole, had he <strong>not</strong> been fractured by the virus of poverty?"</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our minds begin scanning for solutions that aim towards a Greater Good,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">towards Word Peace, International Convergence on Wisdom, Unites States of The World.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We begin seeing that although there isn't an answer to every question,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there are Dreams that could prevent the worst of World's Mistakes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Building schools to help a culture grow,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">instead of forecasting war and manufacturing enough weapons.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Preventing the existence of criminals,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by helping little children to Happy Homes, and to a Universal Basic Income.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Trading simple schools and grades for Business Success,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">helping children to become Well Funded Entrepreneurs and Investors.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No matter which questions we begin with and how our path is arranged,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we discover how critical Growing Up is, for us, for eveyone.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">How much more we are,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">than mere followers of the rules that we are born to.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">How important to our mental health,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is not to fall a victim to bad ideas or fractures of poverty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our First Great Act in life is lifting ourselves above the culture we are born into,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that is the meaning of the words Rising, Growing Up, Breaking Away, Becoming Stronger.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And the acts of independent thinking that are sure to follow,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are the very foundation of Our Hope in a Better Future.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Have no fear of Rising, of Breaking Away, of Growing Up, of Growing In Strength,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for that is Adulthood, and none can stay children for long.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Close your eyes, and begin building,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because your next step is to become a Great Being.</div>
