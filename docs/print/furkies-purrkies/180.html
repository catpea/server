  <p>To the question &#x201C;how far must I go&#x201D;,</p>
  <p>there is but one answer, and it is never to be uttered quietly.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You must feel it and yell it,</p>
  <p>yell it because every moment is a precious miracle.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>So you yell: Higher!</p>
  <p>Because higher is the answer, and it the only answer there ever was.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Higher, because we never know how far we need to go and grow,</p>
  <p>so it is just is better, to keep going and never stop, ever, no matter how much you know.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Don&#x2019;t stop for bullies,</p>
  <p>don&#x2019;t stop for teachers,</p>
  <p>don&#x2019;t stop for the office,</p>
  <p>don&#x2019;t stop for a career,</p>
  <p>just fly right by.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Because, the first and foremost is to break out of all limits,</p>
  <p>breach, each and every boundary, and rise right on top, over and over, and tip each tipping point.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Every book that makes Wise Beings smile,</p>
  <p>read it, read it many times, record the good parts and play them back to sleep.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And then after your first ten or twenty books, or hundred books,</p>
  <p>you write your own, and make it known.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And keep moving,</p>
  <p>and don&#x2019;t stop,</p>
  <p>because every wall must fall.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>That A in class, that GPA in college, that Promotion and Office Window,</p>
  <p>all of that has to go.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is amazing to return to, from the great heights of your mountains,</p>
  <p>but for now you go, because you are not a brick in that wall.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Find your limits,</p>
  <p>and build your way out.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Our flaw is such, that we don&#x2019;t notice bad ideas that we are born around,</p>
  <p>and if we keep growing into that life we will run aground.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>All you need to do, is become a Great Being first,</p>
  <p>then you can come back, and if you want it all, then you can have it all back.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>...but first you grow, because without growing first, you&#x2019;ll never know which way to go.</p>
</div></div>
