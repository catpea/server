    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">For Contributions To Human Kind</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">First of all, I want you to know, that you could win that Prize.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">bestowed upon those who made the greatest contributions to humankind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And that there are multiple pathways,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so as long as you are in the right place, somewhere out on the edge.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is hard to say a bad thing about it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but the road there is not perfect.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>The schools are not working<sup>[1]</sup></span> for one,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and as always there will be troublemakers and liars along the way.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You will be forced to learn strange and ultimately meaningless things to get into a brand name college,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">tested by an outdated ever-being-phased-out process, and you need the full 1600 score, to send a message.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You need to <span>start preparing for the SAT years ahead of graduating high school<sup>[2]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">at first your entire education must be structured to unhinge the SAT patterns.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Apply to all the expensive colleges,,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and <span>learn to relax but keep moving, fast.<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are not going to give the Senior Orator speech,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because to get at the Prize you will not have the time to follow all instructions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Then you will need to find a lab that is doing cutting edge research,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and begin scanning the unknown for anomalies, don't focus on what seems interesting, so much as what is anomalous and unexplored.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You will become a World Class Scientist, you will become a force of science, you will be huge, a perfect expert in your field,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and with a touch of luck easily find something, maybe in anti-aging, or DNA recombination, computer integration.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That will nearly guarantee you the Prize,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it will be a great accomplishment.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Worse comes to worst, it may just be that the Prize Committee is not going to be as forward in their thinking as they should be,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but that will be just as good as the prize, you will know it, the history books will know it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is a lot of forks in the road, yes,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the correct paths rely on luck, yes, but you can make your own luck by standing at the fork long enough.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once you get into the university, <span>the outsider-teacher will say the truth: they don't know if the grades and classes and guidance, will help you at all<sup>[4]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they are teaching blind, and throwing these blind tests at your feet, which is more like interference than help, isn't it?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There will be bumps in the road,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">unfairness along the way.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What happened to <span>Rosalind Franklin<sup>[5]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is beyond heartbreaking.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think, I want you to have more than a prize,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I don't want anybody to fight things that should honor them, be it school or whichever company you care to work at.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If the schools were working,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if you didn't need to fight odds.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you could start in High School,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">not a lab at 40, then this could be balanced with life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are not machines, we aren't meant to bend odds that are against us out of stupidity, greed, inauthenticity, shortsightedness, or whether or not our parents work in that lab,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we shouldn't need to sacrifice on our way towards that kind of greatness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Rosalind Franklin... Elsie was fighting the same fight that stands in your way,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and liars are cunning, and evil, and they drain us of energy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What the hell does a Dean at a Brand Name University know about what it takes to be like Elsie,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the things claiming to help you will be attacking you if not downright stalking you out of debt, greed, jealousy, the same damn nonsense that has always held humanity back.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Remember Sun Tzu?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It may be that the world isn't good enough to appreciate the many sacrifices that you will surely make along the way,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I want you to choose living a healthy and balanced life, where DNA recombination is something you do as a second thought with the person that you will end up sharing the rest of your very long and very happy life with.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I don't want you to fight the odds,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the odds should always be on your side, and every step of your journey to make lasting contributions to Human Kind should be Honored, even before you get your Prize.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I want the world to work for you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">not against you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And I don't want you to be alone like Elsie,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the countless many whose names we don't yet know, or may never know.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I know that there are people who will help you along the way,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">people who monitor those who aim the highest, and help them graduate, and get the job, and the lab, and all they need.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But maybe before you set of for that kind of greatness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you should consider Wisdom, Books and Adventure, Art and Music.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Become Wise first,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and then see what your aims are, then.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Maybe you won't need to take that test,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it's not like it is a real test of real knowledge.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And if you still need a lab,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then why not build one, both for you and those brilliant many who discovered the odds against them to be too overwhelming.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For you and Elsie,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">pure research, pure madness, raw talent.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Sometimes, when something stands in your way,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is a signal that you should build the path you wish you had, for others to walk it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Maybe the honest school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we all once needed?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is a man in a video entitled "<span>What is the Appalachian Trail?<sup>[6]</sup></span>",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">who at 6 minutes and 27 seconds says:</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"<span>By the world standards I don't have anything, but I stand before you now and tell you, I'm the richest man there is.<sup>[7]</sup></span>"</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think it maybe best that each Human Being should find their Wisdom and Enlightenment,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">before, setting their aims.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Rise First, and then help the world grow, and in a way that comes naturally to you, that completes you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">where the path before you isn't against odds, but matches your unique predispositions for greatness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It isn't really about that particular prize,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is it?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is a call to greatness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is a call directly to you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is meant to be answered in a way that fits you best,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that makes you better and stronger.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Here you need not worry about odds,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or interference from schools or labs meant to help you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And you get to read or listen to books that you pick,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and not ones that are picked for you by strangers who can't even tell if any of it will be useful to you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I say,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">dream even bigger.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And if you must, then remember it is not just Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is also Literature, and Peace.</div>
