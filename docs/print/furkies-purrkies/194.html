      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Real Education is Sweet Exploration</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real education is a Great Empowering Adventure,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that begins, with what is interesting to us.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It's how Human Beings progress forward,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it's how Socrates, DaVinci, Bruno, Newton, became known.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They followed a path as dictated by their mind,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and that dictation occurs, once precise layer after another.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You can become a genius within 10 years,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but this is not a race, it is best to take 30 years.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Thirty is perfect.</div>
  <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
    <br>
  </div>
  <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
    <div class="paragraph">Don't worry, the schools are broken,</div>
    <div class="paragraph">they are exactly as worthless as you think they are.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
    <div class="paragraph">Grades are an insult to your mind,</div>
    <div class="paragraph">and teachers will spew all kinds of nonsense but they just want to get paid.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
    <div class="paragraph">Be warned, my Friend,</div>
    <div class="paragraph">the classroom is the worst thing that can happen to a curious mind,</div>
    <div class="paragraph">it will slice everything into boring irrelevant disconnected facts,</div>
    <div class="paragraph">and force you into performing memory tricks with things that you will never want to remember.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
    <div class="paragraph">Resist, but don't drop out,</div>
    <div class="paragraph">just go to the library.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
    <div class="paragraph">Eventually, you'll end at at the deans office,</div>
    <div class="paragraph">just tell them the truth, you fell in love with Learning.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
    <div class="paragraph">The Dean will tag you as a genius,</div>
    <div class="paragraph">but you can't allow this to happen.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
    <div class="paragraph">You are not gifted, you are not a genius - we are all geniuses.</div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph">All the other kids you left behind,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">they need you to tell them that school is not teaching.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph">It is only making you role-play with memorization tricks,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">it is actually preventing everyone from learning.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <br>
    </div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph">This is not intentional,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">there is no government conspiracy.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph">Only mediocrity, people who are just trying to fake it until they make it.</div>
      <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
        <div class="paragraph">I am sorry.</div>
        <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
          <div class="paragraph">But if you just keep to the library,</div>
          <div class="paragraph">keep making your way through all the lovable books.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
          <div class="paragraph">And above all, watch over the others,</div>
          <div class="paragraph">keep an eye on the ones who are cracking.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
          <div class="paragraph">They need your help,</div>
          <div class="paragraph">they need a way out.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
          <div class="paragraph">They don't need hand holding,</div>
          <div class="paragraph">they just need a way out.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
          <div class="paragraph">That way is: Start-ups, building a little business,</div>
          <div class="paragraph">building on their own ideas, in their own universe,</div>
          <div class="paragraph">tell them to look up Y-Combinator and find something like it.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
          <div class="paragraph">This way, if they fail, they will have an opportunity to come back up,</div>
          <div class="paragraph">by saying "The world has failed me, but I will not fail myself, I will not let them crush me."</div>
        </div>
        <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
          <br>
        </div>
        <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
          <div class="paragraph">Help the others to books, the weird kids, well the really weird kids that actually like math,</div>
          <div class="paragraph">they will love Brian Greene, they may not necessarily read the whole book,</div>
          <div class="paragraph">or even enjoy Quantum Physics, they just need to know that they can understand it.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
          <div class="paragraph">Most of the kids will needed Audio Books,</div>
          <div class="paragraph">we can't really read as well as the Author,</div>
          <div class="paragraph">an in any way there is five ways to voice a paragraph, leave it to the author.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
          <div class="paragraph">And then Documentaries, Climate, Education, Philosophy,</div>
          <div class="paragraph">start with Astra Taylor maybe.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
          <br>
        </div>
        <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
          <div class="paragraph">Everyone has their own path, each student has a unique beginning,</div>
          <div class="paragraph">which is marked by natural curiosity, comfort, and a sense of progression.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
          <div class="paragraph">Moreover, once they take that first step and taste their first lesson,</div>
          <div class="paragraph">the second lesson will come much easier, because in their mind,</div>
          <div class="paragraph">it is connected, it is connected by the path they are on.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
          <br>
        </div>
        <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
          <div class="paragraph">In school when when we switch from Language to Math, Music, and Biology,</div>
          <div class="paragraph">there is no path, there is no continuity, there can only be temporary memorization,</div>
          <div class="paragraph">and permanent forgetting.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
          <div class="paragraph">There is no building one layer after another towards Wisdom and Enlightenment,</div>
          <div class="paragraph">there is just graduation and desperation that leads to a shitty job.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
          <div class="paragraph">Such a blind, dead end, death march toward the end of youth, cheerfulness, and dreams,</div>
          <div class="paragraph">will induce depression, self medication, acting out, fighting, and sometimes addiction or worse.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
          <div class="paragraph">Add grades, that many stupid teachers passionately care about,</div>
          <div class="paragraph">to the point of not just thinking that students are stupid,</div>
          <div class="paragraph">but actually convincing many of the students,</div>
          <div class="paragraph">that the pointless grade is a measure of of their intelligence.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
          <div class="paragraph">Sit them in rows to listen to incomprehensible curricula,</div>
          <div class="paragraph">that can only be blindly memorized, by a half crazed madman.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
          <div class="paragraph">Sprinkle in a bunch of bullies,</div>
          <div class="paragraph">with a mix of not-my-problem teachers that can only proclaim "Life isn't fair for us all."</div>
        </div>
        <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
          <div class="paragraph">And, then when they come home, add parents that punish them for no longer having any respect left for them.</div>
          <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
            <br>

          <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
            <div class="paragraph">It is not just schools that were created to try to help you,</div>
            <div class="paragraph">there is a backup,</div>
            <div class="paragraph">countless writers writing specifically to you the younger generation, you.</div>
          </div>
          <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

          </div>
          <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
            <div class="paragraph">Make sure nobody drops out,</div>
            <div class="paragraph">make sure they finish listening to their Audio Books.</div>
