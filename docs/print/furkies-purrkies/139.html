  <p>Nope, we may not finish school, get a job, buy a house, and worry about old age;</p>
  <p>My Dear fiends, I forbid you, and you&apos;re not even not allowed anyway.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>I don&apos;t know who came up with thins nonsense,</p>
  <p>and I don&apos;t know why our parents repeat it - though I have some theories.</p>

  <p>You are to figure out what moves you,</p>
  <p>and get on with it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>What moves you,</p>
  <p>is also what helps you grow.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>What moves you,</p>
  <p>will make you extremely strong and beautiful.</p>

  <p>And it may very well be that it is some kind of a career,</p>
  <p>but there will certainly be something better.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Becoming a professional,</p>
  <p>and spending the rest of your life as that professional - are very different things.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>In deed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And what is more, my Dear Fiends,</p>
  <p>is that you will be making that initial choice under the influence;</p>
  <p>of being too young to actually make decisions of that magnitude.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You will surely be beautiful and powerful enough to make it,</p>
  <p>but when you enter your early Mighty Middle Age,</p>
  <p>you will be even more Beautiful and even more Capable.</p>

  <p>What seemed like a Delicious Challenge in your youth,</p>
  <p>will no longer challenge you enough.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I am sorry.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But something as simple as a fine direction chosen in early life,</p>
  <p>will soon be no longer be enough to do you justice.</p>

  <p>Life is living.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>It will never be as simple as quitting gym,</p>
  <p>and saying &quot;I can&apos;t... I have a job now.&quot;.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Nope.</p>

  <p>Nuh uh.</p>

  <p>Now, you need to quit your job,</p>
  <p>and start catching up, surpass what you once were, and now build on top of that.</p>

  <p>Your undertakings are,</p>
  <p>are not to subtract from you.</p>

  <p>Our lives come with a limit,</p>
  <p>it is a terrible tragedy, and I am very sorry.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But it also makes it that much more important,</p>
  <p>that we grow, that we flourish, that we bloom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>That every new day of our life,</p>
  <p>adds to the previous.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>When all our pursuits are connected meaningfully together in authenticity,</p>
  <p>they become an enormous treasure, and a song of ourselves.</p>

  <p>Life may look simple from the first step before we start growing up.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But it becomes clear that it is more important to live an Inspired Existence that Adds Unto Us,</p>
  <p>at the very least, because of how much we grow, and how much more we become the best of ourselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Life is so dear,</p>
  <p>it is not a very good idea to follow what someone else expects of us.</p>

  <p>You are always growing in complexity,</p>
  <p>and the universe around you will unfold as more complex too.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>For example, we don&apos;t get old,</p>
  <p>we grow, we expand, eventually gaining the ability to speak about our experience; and inspire and move crowds.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Growing old is what a brainless fruit does,</p>
  <p>we are Philosophers, Poets, Artists,</p>
  <p>we are always growing, renewing, living, we don&apos;t lose anything - we gain.</p>
