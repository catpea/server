      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Three Dimensional Business Development: Portable Clonal Colonies</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The Trembling Giant is a clonal colony of aspen determined to be a single living organism,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and assumed to have one massive underground root system, it contains 47,000 trees.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This text is about taking your first beautiful company,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with an imaginative and eye catching product...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And then making a much more powerful business out of it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by selling its clones to many business people.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Where your original product sold for $29.99,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the clones of companies that make that product will bring you a much greater figure.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A company represents a dream, people will pay for the upfront setup,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and then pay you monthly until the company is fully paid off.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So you go from $29.99 to relatively impossibly-large-figures,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by simply abandoning your product and selling copies of your company.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now, here a hardened business person will check me,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">no doubt to share a wisdom valuable for brick and mortar shops.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And here comes the first warning, do not open a physical location,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and don't deal with anything that requires a warehouse.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let me make that clear, no physical goods, no building improvements and remodeling, no cleaning supplies, no employee uniforms,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">no equipment repairs and maintenance, no HVAC maintenance, no miscellaneous supplies, no mortgage or lease payments, no physical location,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">no signage, no utilities; or it will bleed you dry and push you into a bankruptcy (which is much better than school loans)</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do not create a business that will consume your company,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if it stops making money for a few months.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have to create a machine that only comes to life when a sale is made,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that only extracts fees from a ready made sale.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Remember, you are selling copies of this company,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">your customers should only see a simple relationship between advertising and sales, that is it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The company must be easily operated via the internet,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and as 2020 taught us great emphasis should be placed on telecommuting, or remote jobs.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Artificial Intelligence is not going to get here any time soon,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if anything AI is just a stupid trick that corporations use to cut expenses by replacing employees with touchscreens for customers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And AI can only emerge of out accidents,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it will not be a system that will be able to improve it self, it will never know how it works.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are Eight Billion People out there,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">an you are building a lightweight company that only calls for employees when something needs to be done.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This could mean that <span>the company goes dormant during incompatible times<sup>[1]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or that you keep employing more and more and more and more, but only when there is more and more work to be done.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As the job queue becomes smaller,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the number of workers you employ in your template company will scale down.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once you sell 1,000 such companies, 1,000 copies of that original,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the regulars won't really care if they are working for a clone in Bangalore, Johannesburg, or Rio.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Premature optimization and automation is your friend,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">squeeze everything down to the most robotic and lightweight implementation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That will be your seed,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you will now be able to see what is constricting it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Too much automation, not enough variability,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">impossible growth due to over optimization in a particular fragment.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All of these anomalies reveal pathways towards growth,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and whatever does function in its lightweight mode can only make the company better.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us look at that original business, the template,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if that is all you wanted to build, you would aim for something that makes more than $10,000 month.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But now that you are building a network of clones,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you have to ask how much does a clone-company like that need-to-make-a-month to sell well.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It could be 1,000 with minimal advertising,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there are millions of people in this world who would be happy to make 1,000 a month.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">How much should you sell a 1,000 a month company for,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">maybe $24,000, maybe $50,000.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And how are those people going to pay that sum?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">now listen carefully.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are not allowed to put people desperate for money,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in more debt, the banks that used to do that employed the worst kinds of human beings.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They will pay you with a fair percent of their monthly income,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if $100 is all they will make on that particular month, then all you will get is a $10 towards that $24,000.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Make sure to hold up the banks that stole whatever money poor people had left,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as an example of who not to do business with.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">See <span>TCF Bank tricked customers into expensive overdrafts, federal agency says<sup>[2]</sup></span>, <span>TCF experiments with new overdraft fee policy<sup>[3]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and <span>CFPB&#x2019;s TCF Bank Overdraft Fee Case Has Echoes of Wells Fargo&#x2019;s Fraud<sup>[4]</sup></span></div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In the end, come your age of wisdom, building a company that does nothing to help poor people,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is not worth your time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That clever $1 down to trap a person into a legally binding contract,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is a disgrace, an insult, and just as predatory as relying on bounced checks and other customer fees for a big share of your profits.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<p>Now, the easy part,</p>
<p>as to the structure of your company...</p>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Don't invent anything new,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">clone what others wish they could own.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">After all, your business is about selling clones of a fetching company,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and later on, about letting your clients pick from many templates of successful companies.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I am convinced many of your clients will own multiple clones,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and they will use them to reinforce one another.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">On the front-end, are things that make the customer of a clone company happy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">on the back-end is the administrator zone, AND! a place for freelancers to perform whatever actions the company needs to grow.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For example, imagine City Photography, Inc,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">which is patterned after <span>Unsplash<sup>[5]</sup></span> owned by two teenager co-founders.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They are coordinating photography projects from all the cities in United States,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">all the photographs are free to use without registration, the participating photographers, can win awards, get a beautiful portfolio and job experience.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This company makes money from product and business placement,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">from the brand names that models wear, and the cars that appear in exclusive photos.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">These two teenagers, want to photograph all the landmarks in United States,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and they can achieve that by putting a small monetary bounty on particular landmarks.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They may request slow motion video, time lapse photography, tilt shift photography,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">areal drone photography, and set the bounties as needed.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Over time, they will discover more ways of monetizing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because monetization depends on their users.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For example, City Photography, Inc can allow its users to give each other Monetary Tips, including monthly,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and then take a small percentage of that, this would represent maybe 5% of their moneymaking.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There would be many more ways that City Photography, Inc takes an unobtrusive cut of something,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this may include brand names advertising their labels on the front page, popular users paying for a spotlight and so on.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">City Photography, Inc may grow, it maybe purchased by a larger company as the case it with Unsplash,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or it may fade away releasing all its photographs to Web Archive, or similar under the Public Domain license.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The number one deciding factor for what will happen to a company is the chaos and randomness of the business world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the number two deciding factor is timing, if high quality photography is something that the world is interested in, then they will thrive.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The end of life for City Photography, Inc,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is just a new beginning for out two co-founders, no longer teenagers now, but just as sharp and passionate about business and big dreams.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They will take to another type of business you sell,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as they will now be intricately familiar with what it is like to engage in running a company, with a remote-work back-end that cater to freelancers around the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In closing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">create a beautiful little company, have fun with it, and when you are done covert it into a template,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and begin selling clones of that company to others.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Don't stop here, look to other businesses that are fun to use, launch, run,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and copy them, bring in their template into your system so that people that buy companies from you can have multiple choices.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And don't be evil, don't bother with companies that do nothing for those who live in poverty,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they are not worth your time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Come your final days, no matter how many times you will say to yourself "I made a difference",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you will never fully believe it, unless you truly did make a different, unless you truly did grow to become a Great Being that helped the world grow.</div>
