  <p>Real Education, makes you, more you,</p>
  <p>it greatly enhances your all predispositions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>No one has the right to hold you in contempt for your talents,</p>
  <p>no one has the right to tell you who you should become.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>All pursuits of excellence lead to Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness,</p>
  <p>the longer it takes the more precious the result.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Ignore the so called teachers that will try to control you, or sway you off your path,</p>
  <p>their only wish is to make their own lives easier even if it means sacrificing who you are.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Real education is somehow completely misunderstood,</p>
  <p>and people do end up getting lost in life.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>For example, some may enjoy a single subject,</p>
  <p>and fall behind on all the rest.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Then, to fix their grades,</p>
  <p>they are made to focus on fixing subjects that they are bad at.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>In the process they interrupt themselves,</p>
  <p>they are made to interfere with their own, more-real education.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And, here the beneficiary is the teacher and the dean,</p>
  <p>and the reward is eventual raises for keeping GPAs stable.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Long after these frauds are gone,</p>
  <p>their victims suffer, never having found a comfortable place.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Sometimes, even after the fools are gone people continue feeling guilt for their talents,</p>
  <p>they become convinced that doodles are dumb, and poems are stupid.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is hard to find happiness in doing things that we don&apos;t care about,</p>
  <p>it maybe impossible even.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A life void of happiness,</p>
  <p>is a life of depression and constant anxiety.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Even the smallest of our predispositions will develop into unique greatness,</p>
  <p>a greatness that is hard to see at first, hard to reason about.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Let me make this clear, Real Education is not about getting a job,</p>
  <p>it is about becoming a Great Being, who has much more to add.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

<div class="section">
  <p>And some people,</p>
  <p>are a little bit ahead of their time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>For example kids that like to fly drones,</p>
  <p>may never fully get into it, unless...</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>they get access to drones equipped with cameras,</p>
  <p>that they can steer through a VR helmet, as if they were piloting them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>If they stick with it,</p>
  <p>they will enter electronics, mathematics and software development.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>If they get bored, or can&apos;t afford the hardware,</p>
  <p>then they will lose something of themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Rule of thumb here,</p>
  <p>is to take a predisposition all the way, at all cost.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Hobbies or silly interests are gateways into sciences,</p>
  <p>and should always be honored and seen as something very special.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>One massive problem is the teachers and parents,</p>
  <p>who when lacking similar predispositions will tend to destroy talent.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And they do it because they don&apos;t want their kid to stick out,</p>
  <p>they don&apos;t need the extras and the questions that come along with them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>They may say that games are for children,</p>
  <p>and talents are useless.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>They will say such things because they can&apos;t handle life,</p>
  <p>as someone took their talent away and now everything is cumbersome and more than they bargain for.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Coupled with organized and standardized schooling</p>
  <p>that divide subjects into meaninglessness and noise that can only be memorized.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Sprinkle in some bullies,</p>
  <p>that hate kids that stick out.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>All that on top of already bad grades,</p>
  <p>as the student may not even be aware that everyone is just memorizing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And much is lost,</p>
  <p>and most permanently.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>Real Education is a source of joy, strength,</p>
  <p>and contributes to love of life.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The effects of real education</p>
  <p>are hard to describe.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is the different between a pop star, and a girl forced to repeat the semester because she used to like music.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is the difference between,</p>
  <p>a quickly forgotten politician and a famous philosopher that continues to inspire generations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Between a writer that dabbles in forgettable romance novels,</p>
  <p>and one that helps us to understand a strange world of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkPR4Rcf4ww">tyranny without tyrants</a> one that we must reject.</p>

  <p>Real education creates beings that change lives,</p>
  <p>their Works come out of Greatness, nobly fueled by Wisdom and Knowledge.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>To deny the becoming of a Great Being is to deny Growing Up,</p>
  <p>it means to deny joy, happiness, and love of life.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Everyone is acting as if Greatness and Great Wisdom is rare,</p>
  <p>all the while they are stopping each other from a Real Education.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is Real Education that brings people into areas of Knowledge that they are predisposed to further,</p>
  <p>granting them Wisdom, and eventually Greatness.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>People who conspire against talent,</p>
  <p>are Guidance Counselors, Teachers, and Parents, precisely those who are meant to encourage it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We must honor the talents and predispositions of the younger generations,</p>
  <p>by building personalized educational systems that lead them to Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We must remove all barriers that stand in their way,</p>
  <p>the future of the world is in their hands.</p>
