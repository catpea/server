    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Fight For Your Greatness</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real Education, makes you, more you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it greatly enhances your all predispositions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No one has the right to hold you in contempt for your talents,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">no one has the right to tell you who you should become.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All pursuits of excellence lead to Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the longer it takes the more precious the result.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Ignore the so called teachers that will try to control you, or sway you off your path,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">their only wish is to make their own lives easier even if it means sacrificing who you are.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real education is somehow completely misunderstood,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and people do end up getting lost in life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For example, some may enjoy a single subject,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and fall behind on all the rest.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Then, to fix their grades,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they are made to focus on fixing subjects that they are bad at.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In the process they interrupt themselves,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they are made to interfere with their own, more-real education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And, here the beneficiary is the teacher and the dean,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the reward is eventual raises for keeping GPAs stable.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Long after these frauds are gone,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">their victims suffer, never having found a comfortable place.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Sometimes, even after the fools are gone people continue feeling guilt for their talents,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they become convinced that doodles are dumb, and poems are stupid.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is hard to find happiness in doing things that we don't care about,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it maybe impossible even.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A life void of happiness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is a life of depression and constant anxiety.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even the smallest of our predispositions will develop into unique greatness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a greatness that is hard to see at first, hard to reason about.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let me make this clear, Real Education is not about getting a job,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is about becoming a Great Being, who has much more to add.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And some people,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are a little bit ahead of their time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For example kids that like to fly drones,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">may never fully get into it, unless...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">they get access to drones equipped with cameras,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that they can steer through a VR helmet, as if they were piloting them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If they stick with it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they will enter electronics, mathematics and software development.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If they get bored, or can't afford the hardware,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then they will lose something of themselves.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Rule of thumb here,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is to take a predisposition all the way, at all cost.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Hobbies or silly interests are gateways into sciences,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and should always be honored and seen as something very special.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One massive problem is the teachers and parents,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">who when lacking similar predispositions will tend to destroy talent.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And they do it because they don't want their kid to stick out,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they don't need the extras and the questions that come along with them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They may say that games are for children,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and talents are useless.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They will say such things because they can't handle life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as someone took their talent away and now everything is cumbersome and more than they bargain for.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Coupled with organized and standardized schooling</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that divide subjects into meaninglessness and noise that can only be memorized.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Sprinkle in some bullies,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that hate kids that stick out.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All that on top of already bad grades,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as the student may not even be aware that everyone is just memorizing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And much is lost,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and most permanently.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real Education is a source of joy, strength,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and contributes to love of life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The effects of real education</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are hard to describe.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is the different between a pop star, and a girl forced to repeat the semester because she used to like music.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is the difference between,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a quickly forgotten politician and a famous philosopher that continues to inspire generations.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Between a writer that dabbles in forgettable romance novels,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and one that helps us to understand a strange world of <span>tyranny without tyrants<sup>[1]</sup></span> one that we must reject.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real education creates beings that change lives,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">their Works come out of Greatness, nobly fueled by Wisdom and Knowledge.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To deny the becoming of a Great Being is to deny Growing Up,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it means to deny joy, happiness, and love of life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Everyone is acting as if Greatness and Great Wisdom is rare,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">all the while they are stopping each other from a Real Education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is Real Education that brings people into areas of Knowledge that they are predisposed to further,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">granting them Wisdom, and eventually Greatness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">People who conspire against talent,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are Guidance Counselors, Teachers, and Parents, precisely those who are meant to encourage it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We must honor the talents and predispositions of the younger generations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by building personalized educational systems that lead them to Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We must remove all barriers that stand in their way,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the future of the world is in their hands.</div>
