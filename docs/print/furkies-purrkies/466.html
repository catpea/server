    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The New Wonder Of The World</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What we need to talk about,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is Art.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Somehow,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in all this incredible complexity of our Universe...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A set of lectures by a magnificent teacher,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will always beat the snot out of the best AI.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That is why I say that our Life and Mind,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">should be a Masterpiece, that it is a work of art.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The best lessons, that teach us the most,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">must be crafted by an artist.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A powerful, knowledgeable, wise, and inspirational teacher,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">someone that knows the weaknesses, and loves to help.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is one itsy-bitsy little bit, that is highly computerized,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and that is the path that students take through the lectures.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">See not everyone is interested in all the things the lecture holds,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so a set of lectures has to be flexible, and that means computerized.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And this is great, because it means the teacher gives the lecture once,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and then it becomes infinitely re-playable, by an infinite number of students.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But please note that this is the simplest lecture model,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is best used for teachers that are deeply connected to their lecture.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Single-teacher lectures,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are primary for the purpose of honoring the teachers and their art of teaching.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The standard lecture format,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is very similar to a wikipedia category.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are many students,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">continuously improving the various lectures in the set.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And let me just say that they are all volunteers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">money-making or hoarding has no place in education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">School and Knowledge is meant to be free,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">otherwise it is just fraud, perpetrated on the future generations.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is more than volunteers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and quality of the lectures.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is also the usefulness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the clarity.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Today, when a student does not understand mathematics,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they are encouraged and forced to pretend to understand it by memorization, by acting.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The force is pretty formidable,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they will be punished with grades, that will destroy their GPA, and in some cases sent to prison, the prison of repeating a year.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The future generations will never forgive us for this,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I don't event want to tell you what they will think of us.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In a real school, when actually learning for real,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">getting snagged on something is no different then discovering something uniquely interesting about a subject.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Not understanding something very well,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and wanting to understand something very much, is the same thing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In today's schools, one leads to being told to pay attention, or else,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the other to the barbaric act of actually being punished.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think the first subject that people have difficulty with,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is mathematics.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Mathematics, is actually taught wrong,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the lectures are so broken, that they likely transformed into a memorization dog an pony show.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And memorization is not education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is just make-believe, it is just acting.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are teachers out there that can help students understand,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but it is actually really bad for the classroom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Because lovingly teaching all students to understand all the concepts,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will require far more time then what a class has before the final.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There will not be enough time to cover all the concepts,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the class curriculum is not meant for real education, but mere memorization.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The bureaucracy of the school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">does not care that you are educated, they only care that you pass the tests.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What is there to be done in this situation?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that part is really easy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I call it "The Million Student March",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but don't worry, you don't have to get up from your chair.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What you have to do is stop pretending,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">your willingness to cram, to memorize, is helping this strange theater carry on.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have to stop pretending that memorization is an education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and start learning for real, on your own.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And this part is really, really, important,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there are some subjects that are so important, that without their knowledge you will be immanently tricked.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Stop memorizing for school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and start learning for real.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Learn Chemistry, Microbiology, Your Biology and how the Human Body operates,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and either take up an interest in Astrobiology, Medicine, or Combinatorial Genomics; follow your curiosity.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You need to know about physics, don't worry about the formulas - as that comes next, and it can't be easier,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">learn about circus, electricity, and build your own models that for example recharge batteries with solar power.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For the love of all things amazing, get some wires, batteries, a multi-meter,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and especially analog Amp and Volt gauges to see them come to life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You need to learn how to built a radio,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and you need to <span>build a tiny transmitter<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are free to learn all the cool things now,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you can lean anything.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And there is a very special subject,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that as everything else has been horribly misrepresented.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And this particular goodie,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">grants you the ability to get inside any system of any complexity.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This subject is so powerful that you can do experiments on spacetime it self,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by actually simulating sustained acceleration for prolonged periods such as <span>Project Orion<sup>[2]</sup></span> describes,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and run tests on things like <span>gravitational singularities<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I am of course describing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Programming<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Programming is how you learn mathematics for real,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for one, the notation is consistent, <span>as Math As Code states: "Mathematical symbols can mean different things depending on the author, context and the field of study"<sup>[5]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Don't worry, <span>school wasn't teaching you real math anyway<sup>[6]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>you were just learning an easy to pretend-to-learn fragment mostly for the bureaucrats, and so that the teachers would keep getting paid<sup>[7]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the <span>real math is actually pretty cool<sup>[8]</sup></span> and full of interesting mysteries.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But you can't approach, neural networks or combinatronics for example, directly,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the way school presents these subjects is basically toxic, insane, deadly, and crazy - it is deeply heartless.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The right way to approach neural networks,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is by looking at <span>Simple Letter Detection or maybe Color Contrast examples over at brain.js<sup>[9]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and follow up with a <span>couple of videos<sup>[10]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think even more illustrative of the need for programming is combinatronics,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the way you would get at it, is by cracking passwords in a cute little hacker game that you would program as part of learning programming.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The complicated subjects in mathematics,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are so trivial in the programming word, that no programmer dares to say a thing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Start learning programming by taking to JavaScript,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and <span>Learning how to mess around with P5.js<sup>[11]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once you advance, even if just a little bit,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you will be able to create a lecture based on the path you took.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Other people working on the same subject,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will be able to help you more, if you collaborate with them on a beautiful interactive lecture.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A lecture is a work of art,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">different people may wish to take a unique path through it, but it really comes down to the presentations and visualizations.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Biology is a very interesting subject to study and learn about from simulations on a computer,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is only one little step to get to medicine, and if you can do both you, you can be pretty sure, that computers are the future.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Can you learn mathematics without Programming,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">no, no you can't.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are some people that like that kind of thing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but for them complexity is something that they need, it is not just about learning math for them, they are choosing the hard way to meditate.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Programming is the first thing you have to learn,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as it wraps all the other things.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It makes everything simple,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and puts impossible things within your reach.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Computers provide the much needed info-graphics, visualizations, interactivity, control and interaction,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when it comes to the creation of lectures for the new class of real schools.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They also provide humanity with a program, that we can call School 1.0,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">call it Virtual Reality School, call it school on a chip, call it a cool computer game.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A computer program that will be able to run on low powered devices,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that will gently step through the much needed real lectures towards a Real Education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The subject I am looking forward to the most is not computers or programming but,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Philosophy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Philosophy has been destroyed by schools<sup>[12]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it became irrelevant to our lives.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But Philosophy is actually the story of Humanity's Childhood,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is the greatest story that has hardly ever been told.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And what is fantastic about teaching Philosophy from a little computer device,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is that it is a dramatized Audio Book, it is probably a thousand hours long, and recorded by countless students, in all our languages.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The Philosophy lectures on this portable school device that your generation will begin work on,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will be hailed as one of the greatest achievements of human kind, it will be seen as the New Wonder Of The World.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The way towards Wold Peace, and Unity,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is always near, but it requires collective courage.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It requires that you stop memorizing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and stand up for your generation, and the future of this world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that you <span>stand up for real education<sup>[13]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Personal Note,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If I,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">may.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Walk up to the students being punished,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and let them know you memorized and don't understand it either.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Help them understand that they are not stupid,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is just that school is broken.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You don't have to become their friend,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">just save them from the toxicity of stress, that can often destroy a mind by pushing them off-course into self medication, with food or alcohol, or worse.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Make sure that the students in the back know,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that there is nothing wrong with them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Most of the time they are scared of becoming homeless,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">which is exactly what the bully will drive them into.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let them know that they don't have to be scared,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and it is actually kind of good that they are already upset at the dog an pony show.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As ultimately, all the A student will find that their work life ended up becoming toxic,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and that why they really needed was to work for themselves, where they could take better care of their mental health.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just tell all the students being punished</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to begin practicing to <span>build their own company<sup>[14]</sup></span>, by building dozens of little ones to help them understand how to do it right.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is what everyone will want,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">eventually.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">discover that I had not lived.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I did not wish to live what was not life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">living is so dear;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">-- Henry</div>
