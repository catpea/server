      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">A Priceless Education That Costs Nothing: Reading Source Code and Writing Programs</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Developing quality custom software will help you show off some of your work,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and proudly point to interesting solutions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A proper and respectful interview that doesn't ask idiotic and incompetent questions,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will only ask you to explain the programs you created.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You will get to talk about challenges you faced,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and proudly explain solutions you implemented or invented.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A real resume does not feature boilerplate clams,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">of how you deliver "on time and under budget".</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And you probably shouldn't mention that you went to school to learn,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if you need someone to push you along to learn, then you will probably need someone to push you along to work.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A real resume is just a list of programs you created,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with a short description about the brilliant ideas within.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This also protects you from toxic environments that will destroy your creativity,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a company that looks for a cookie cutter resume, is full of cookie cutter people, which is terrifying.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is a big and in some cases controversial subject,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so let me give you a real world case.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Eric Steven Raymond, the person behind the <span>Jargon File<sup>[1]</sup></span>, a Hacker's Dictionary,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">states the following in the Education Section of his <span>Resume<sup>[2]</sup></span>:</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"Education</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Undergraduate studies (including some graduate-level courses) in mathematics and philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I have never taken any courses in computer science or software engineering."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Part of the reason why he says that,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is to protect his hard work, he doesn't want people to think that he got his education from some mediocre minimum viable lowest-common-denominator classroom, and a teacher with little real-world experience.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The fact schools don't work very well, if at all, is not a secret,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is in fact the reason behind insulting and idiotic interview questions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The fact that we are each extremely intelligent, and that we are each perfectly capable of becoming a humble Polymath,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is inescapable.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And that is what a competent employer would look for,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a balanced view of the world born from being a jack of all trades and a master of those that are interesting.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">How do you become good on your own...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You look at the top existing programs,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and try to make smaller versions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This will help you establish a baseline,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the baseline is the common industry standard, and in this day and age it means use a popular framework or the bare-bones, that whatever system you are working with is handing you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For example, <span>Bootstrap<sup>[3]</sup></span> the Graphic User Interface library I use,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">used to rely on <span>jQuery<sup>[4]</sup></span> when jQuery was popular and necessary, <span>but as browsers became more sophisticated, they rejected using jQuery and other frameworks<sup>[5]</sup></span>, and just used the bare bones of the browser.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They are a fair baseline for industry standard web interface design,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and they hold all the answers as far as a basic standard web interface is concerned.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To lean from them,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">means to create a tiny clone of their work, your own take on Bootstrap.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Each time you get stuck,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you go to their website and look up how they did it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Since both of you at this point are working on the same thing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they have answers to all your questions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You can make your version perfect,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">creating a Sandalstrap, a more lightweight version of Bootstrap, and that would be one of the items on your resume.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Or you can make a messy version,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">where you purely go for the meat of the system, so your program will barely work, but as you file it away to some dusty git repository in hopes of never receiving a bug fix request, you walk away perfectly knowledgeable.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And then you go a step higher,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you search around for people who used a modern framework to enhance the modernized Bootstrap.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One such project is the <span>BootstrapVue<sup>[6]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">which relies on <span>Vue.js<sup>[7]</sup></span> for enhancing Bootstrap.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Another is <span>Sveltestrap<sup>[8]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">which relies on <span>Svelte<sup>[9]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Programming with Vue.js, Svelte, React, Angular, will give the ability to create web-application,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and between knowing bare-bones, and the large modern framework, you cannot help but to become good.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are likely to end up with several simple and beautiful applications,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">maybe tiny websites that bring in a few dollars, and this then becomes an item on your resume.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Imagine an interview where instead of answering stupid and incompetent questions,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you demo your favorite applications and give an overview of several more.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You learn the bare bones by making your own little versions,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and you learn the high end, by working with those frameworks to make interesting little apps.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now imagine how useful it would be if you had a Video Version of you demoing your apps,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that you could attach to your resume-portfolio.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Nobody is going to ask you if you know OOP, or if you can doodle a user interface layout system media query extravaganza on the white board,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when it is already something that you cover in your video, and clearly feel passionate about.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It takes a long time to figure all this out,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and you are learning so many subjects subjects at the same time, that school at this point seems like a joke.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You would need a couple of decades worth of classes moving at a snail pace,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and even the programs at prestigious universities are off, where they still mention things that are irrelevant and would actually make your software slow had you employed them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Healthcare website launch problems in 2013<sup>[10]</sup></span> were not just about politics and bureaucracy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but useless and outdated technologies and methods, probably the stuff they teach in school.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just the fact alone that many files were being loaded by the browser on launch day,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">instead of organized into one or two compressed and bundled extras, reveals inexperienced programmers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">These lessons can't be emphasized correctly in a school environment,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they come precisely from places like the Bootstrap code base.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It takes 10 minutes to figure it out,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and a few hours to start using mini-fication in all your programs.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And that is it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there is no lecture, no test here, it just becomes obvious and useful.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When you care about learning,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">which is what happens when you are learning things you like, you never need to memorize, or put mini-fication on a todo, you just accept it as reality, and a great idea.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I mention the failure of the 2013 Healthcare website,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because it shows that a college education, and working for prestigious companies, on prestigious projects means nothing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Reality makes it so that fake education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">can only lead to failure.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There isn't a textbook, or a teacher that can emphasize the important things enough,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it has to be practice.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is why Eric Raymond stands up for his Self Education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is the difference between Real Education and Fantasy Education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Reading and learning from source code and then writing your own programs,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is the only realistic way to learn programming for real.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>And you are genius level smart, we all are, but you have to start with baby steps<sup>[11]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it has to be a very comfortable on-ramp, don't start by learning CSS nobody does that, start with what you like and then look at other projects to see how you can make it better.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you ever get stuck, or are unsure where to go next, or aren't sure where to begin,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then go to a video search box type in the thing that interests you the most followed by the word tutorial.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Seeing and hearing many different perspectives from different people will help you balance your understanding,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and find your next step.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Search for tutorials,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">do it, it will be amazing!</div>
