    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Though mighty, we are very delicate creatures,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">our minds require Beauty and Calm to learn the most at their best.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Haste of organized education, threats of losing a 4.0 GPA,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">homework deadlines, and even subconsciously knowing that memorization is not education, will conspire against us.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Learning for real, real education, useful knowledge,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">thriving wisdom, and eventual greatness demands a beautiful and authentic existence.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In real life, getting a diploma by cramming, memorizing, winging it or getting lucky,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">doesn't actually do anything.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Reality, demands real things,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">truth, authenticity, and a healthy existence.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A beautiful life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">requires our full beauty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To bloom, to truly grow up,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we need to be truly free, we need to reside in the real world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is not as easy as it sounds,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">though we all have the ability to set ourselves free from childhood indoctrination.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What about, the less obvious things?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Such as doing badly on a test some years ago, having your GPA permanently lowered because of it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but on the day of graduation, actually being able to perfectly pass that test, but now during graduation it being too late.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So you are accepting a lower GPA, so that you can graduate sooner?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that is not how reality works, and what about the extra motivation that you would receive from keeping a 4.0 GPA throughout your entire stay?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And what about the quality of that test,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and what about the people that passed it because they memorized it without really learning anything?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And what about the fact that that many will never need what was on that test,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in effect the College or University slowing their progress down, distracting them from learning what would help them become more of themselves.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And what about well connected and ingratiated liars, at the company you do end up working at,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">what if after years of tests and textbooks and frightening and stressful debt, a liar dislikes you?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Reality, will make you strong and beautiful, it will make your life meaningful and full of joy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but you have to keep it real, the education must be real, your place of employment must be stable and honest.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">At no point should you be pushed to the side,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and forced to walk a path that is different from who you are.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And do not forget, that we are granted a set amount of time,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">spending more than 30 years in pursuit of school and career that isn't guaranteed to be what you need, should be a tough proposition.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now, a real education coupled with a series of business undertakings that you learn from,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and eventual launch of a successful company based on what you have learned is a lot more stable.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So, High School, College, University and a Career,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">does not hold the same guarantee that Self Education and eventually becoming a Successful Founder, does.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you start leaning towards the Start-up Culture in High School,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you can start building your companies a lot sooner, and begin isolating and mastering the lessons that you actually need in the right sequence and at the right pace.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just for the fact that there are no bullies when you learn on your own,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and zero pressure to memorize, and zero classes that will only distract you from learning what you need, self education is better for your mental health and growing up.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Cults and religions are not the only indoctrination,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they are just the ones that are trivial to catch.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A Real University, would only feature Great Thinkers, Great Actors and Narrators,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but even so, their beautiful performances, though eye catching, would never be as perfectly fitted to you as a series of fine hand-picked audio books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even an imaginary perfect-university, cannot match the power of a collection of audio books that you can listen and re-listen stress free,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as you learn to build you companies and graduate to be able to grasp more and more complex subjects.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Lets just face it, being placed in a situation where you must merely memorize things,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is a sign that you are being taken advantage of.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Learning is not about memorization,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and memorization has nothing to do with learning.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Memorization is best used in poetry,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it a way to give thanks to poets.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even if you memorize numbers of a new language,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">all you have left is a piece of information that is not yet useful.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Memorizing 100 of the most popular words in a language you are learning,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is almost dangerous as you will have trouble with correct pronunciation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To learn a new language, you are best to create a path you can navigate and expand,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">watch a movie you are already familiar with in your native language, and build a transcript.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are good at language,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">just like we are good at dance, don't force it, love it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your Knowledge is sacred,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it empowers your decision making, and helps your dreams come true.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When someone barges in forcing you to heartlessly memorize things,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you must become very suspicious of their motives.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The world is poor, there are slick talking people out there with all kinds of issues,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">sometimes they are deans, principals, teachers, and even parents.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have to find a way to learn things right,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think we all know, that way, is not the school way.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I know you are scared, bad grades, yelling parents, threat of poverty and homelessness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but you see, that won't go away when you graduate by cramming, you are only delaying it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Moreover, by not becoming educated as soon as you can,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you become vulnerable to slick talking attackers, and shitty boyfriends.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is damn hard to catch a liar, so hard that we can almost assume that liars always do win,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is because in their sickens they learn to exploit our cognitive biases.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The way to push back against manipulators,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is to become smarter than they are, and believe you me, this barely takes any effort at all.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">At most, AT MOST, 25 five audio books about modern life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">though they must all have a positive ending, they have to be happy books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">25 audio books is like a month of your life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and, and, and if I may, it will be one of the most beautiful times of your life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You will always return to where you were as you read them,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so you better go to a nice place, or get in your car get on the longest highway and drive.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You can either start your life with a heart break,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or with adventure and audio books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Grab your friends, tell them to behave,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and go together.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If I may make a suggestion, lease stop at every antique store,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as neat as the knickknacks are going to be, look for the most worn out books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I found a saintly copy of Robinson Crusoe,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it fits in my back pocket so perfectly, I can't even.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Look for Jack London, Herman Melville, Daniel Defoe,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and keep an eye out for works by Friedrich Nietzsche.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Use the paper versions to practice narration, but listen to the audio books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they are often out on Librivox.org for free as most of the classics are in public domain.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That is all you need, to create an adventure,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a path to somewhere far that hits as many antique stores as you can drive by.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And promise to drive carefully,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you are not in a hurry.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now, not everyone is ready to write,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but some of you are a lot further along than you think.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Begin by writing a singe compound sentence at a time,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and that's it, don't press, flow.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just like dehydration happens, or we sometimes develop vitamin deficiencies,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and need to pay extra attention to what we put in our bodies.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My friends, same goes for our minds,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">fear or anxiety will cause you harm, you are not to live in fear of any kind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do you know what the symptoms of anxiety are?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Impatience, snapping at small things, thinning hair, wanting to be alone,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">sadness, brain fog, body aches, fatigue, bad sleep habits.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">These are not things that we can fix, you can't take pain killers for body aches from from fear.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">By calling it adventure, I give you a simple choice to make,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but it is more than a simple adventure, I am inviting you on a quest away from the toxic sludge of an unexamined life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In a way, psychology is a young science,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is also the most humble and loving of all the Daughters of Philosophy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There aren't too many answers here,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but there is something, and I can fit it in a sentence for you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The secret to a long and healthy life is:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Happiness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I am asking you to move away from fear and other disorders that create countless issues,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and get on a path towards happiness, because that is a very powerful medicine.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Happiness is quite a thing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is almost on par with wisdom, though I suppose it the end it is one and the same.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Where wisdom makes you a beautiful writer,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">happiness makes you a powerful doctor.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The low key sarcastic, low brow, poker face, dead pan nonsense,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that will feature in your journals due to Happiness and Love of Life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Has the power to bring the most boorish and scared person from the brink of death,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and plop them in the middle of the Shenandoah Valley, walking stick in one hand and a bewildered companion in the other.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I once wondered how we could describe the most powerful beings on earth,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and somehow I came up with a two word description that still frightens-me-a-little to this day:</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The Laughing Philosopher.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">While, I guess, I am not a real doctor, though the results are not quite in yet,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am certain that even those who are deeply sad will find something that will bring them a special kind of Happiness when out on an adventure.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And I would argue, that the saddest of us, are the least likely to be eaten by a bobcat,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or dragged away by a condor.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And I know for certain, that the saddest of us,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are the ones that eventually tell the happiest and most triumphant of stories.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All you need to do, is be aware of the terrible fact,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that the first few days of your adventure will feel wrong; you have to snarl through it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Fight the urge to turn the car around,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that is just the toxic sludge within you fighting for survival, make sure it loses the battle.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It will only take a few days,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and then, everything changes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Oh my, when you get out of your car,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and your hiking or trail running shoes hit the gravel, it is like hearing bells of kissing a hundred woodland faeries.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">By taking that first detoxified step of your new adventure away from lies, bullies, limits and fears,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you can perfectly understand why dogs get zoomies sometimes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And hearing your first chipmunk,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will absolutely put all the damn birds to shame.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No job, or school, or employer, or alarm clock with a creepy snooze button, or any damn thing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">has any right to your joy of life - do you hear me?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You joy of life is sacred,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">everything else has to be secondary.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are at your most beautiful, and you contribute to the world the most,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when you are Happy, and occasionally mischievous.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Call it an adventure, or intellectual hygiene,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but keep your backpack by the door, and may you be always ready, for the call of the wild.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Because that will mark the rise of your own personal University,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the beginning of your quest for real education and wisdom.</div>
