      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The Experimental Class</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I was in a news class,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">one of the kids fell asleep.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The teacher,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">gave him what he called a "wet willy", for which he should have been terminated.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I was supposed to give a speech soon,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I didn't know enough English yet, I was learning at my own pace.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I walked out of the classroom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the teacher was crazy, so I walked out.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The soon to be principal,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">currently involved in creating a class of failures was looking for a control sample.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">He asked me what class I am in,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">why am I in the hall.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I lied,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Great!" - he said, "Follow Me".</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">He told me not to worry about the paper work,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this is my new class.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There was a poster on the wall that said:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Wherever you go there you are".</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We were asked to never say that we feel fine,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because fine didn't explain how we felt.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And we were supposed to explain to the group what we were feeling for real,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it was a nice gesture, everyone turned out to be fighting against he currents.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Bad parents, poverty, bullies,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or in my case crazy teachers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I dropped out from that High School before the class was over,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I lost credits from several classes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Everyone in that class wished me well, I think they asked me to stay strong, and wished me luck on my journey;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they saw my dropping out as the beginning of a journey.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They are all extraordinary people,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">leaders, forces of nature, unbreakable, un-extinguishable, infinitely powerful.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They were some of the most self-aware students in that entire school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and they were not rejects, they were just rejecting in-authenticity.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The soon to become principal was quiet,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">his control sample was dropping out.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But it wouldn't take much for him to figure out that the school was crushing us,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and there was only one way out of that.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I suspect investigations followed, into the creepy teachers I named,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">though probably no one got fired.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I have a vague memory, of AdultEd principal reaching out,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I don't remember if it was because I called for a GED, or she found me walking the road, or called me.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I was treated with great kindness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and told not to worry about a thing, I think the experimental class teachers told her about me, somehow.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I graduated six months early with extra credits,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I went on to college, I ended up on the Deans list, or as I call it the 4.0 GPA Student Retention List.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And dropped out, but this time because I took all their good classes which were few,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I went to work as a programmer - the college didn't have any of those classes - and anyway I learn best, when I study at my own pace and in my own sequence.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">He thought they were all rejects,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">he built a class with all the difficult students.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But they turned out to be some of the wisest and most brilliant and insightful minds in the entire school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we must not allow anybody to rob us of our predispositions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We must stand up for real education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we must not allow anybody to trick us into thinking that temporary memorization is in some magical way an education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Lastly, <span>the principals know that schools are not teaching<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
