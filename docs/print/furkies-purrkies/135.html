    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I dreamt I was tumbling through time,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and I had no control over which fragments I see.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There was a mother writing a letter to a famous movie star,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">she was asking him to stop making movies, because her boy didn't comeback from war.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And it worked,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and she wrote many letters.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There was a lot of shocked artists and actors,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they had no idea how they shaped young impressionable minds.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Boys wanted to go to real war,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to be like the imaginary heroes they saw on TV.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And then I struggled in my dream, because my bullies were clearly ill, they were not all there,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but World's Systems of Justice do not differentiate between the ill and the healthy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And so a person made permanently ill in their mind by poverty,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is seen equal to a man of knowledge, insight, intelligence.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But the ill have little freedom of choice,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they need therapy, and safety, and good homes, and hope, and dreams.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To punish someone who couldn't grow up, didn't know to learn,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for something that they weren't sure they were doing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and then to send them to a hopeless place without a hope of healing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">without any hope of rehabilitation... is wrong.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If they can't walk among us, if they are permanently ill,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then build special schools for them, schools that bring hope.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We mustn't punish them more than life already had,</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>our humanity depends on everyone&#x2019;s humanity<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And I saw Mr. <span>Pirsig<sup>[2]</sup></span> on his motorcycle with his boy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the wind in his face representing the cutting edge of reality.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">He was worried that his Metaphysics is not real philosophy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it was not going to be taken seriously.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The answers they discovered on road they traveled and experiences they shared,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">created the Body of Knowledge that provided them with the forward momentum they needed to move ahead.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I dreamt that Pirsig was just talking bout Authenticity, Nobility and Dignity,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and Knowledge and Wisdom, and Wise Intuition.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">He is unafraid to show us how vulnerable Philosophers are,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that all it takes is ideas worth sharing, once or twice.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Anybody can be a philosopher,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we will each be heard.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All these strange fragments added together - to remind us that the World is Not Static,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that it grows, moves, changes, and cares not to stop for things writ on paper.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Advancements in Psychology... the trailer to the movie about Philip Zimbardo work - alone,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">should invalidate laws and behaviors previously thought acceptable.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Humanity must grow, our cultures must drive us all forward,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we must never assume that the world we are born into is a masterpiece.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And we must never let ourselves think,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that others are in charge - it is our world, it belongs to us all.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To make informed decisions,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we require knowledge, wisdom, foresight, insight, a sense of belonging.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Without knowledge, we will not be able to see right from wrong,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">nor will any of our decisions do our elder selves justice.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Access to well grounded knowledge is not difficult,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">internet lectures - alone - may even suffice, but best selling non fiction audio books solve it completely.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Humanity must not fall behind on growing up,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the longer the delay the greater the injustice.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Read and Listen to you books, my Friends,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">inherit the lifetimes of knowledge within.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We can't send people to prison without any hope of rehabilitation,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for uninformed decisions that came on a whim.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And we can't allow mere Practice of Law without Functional Rehabilitation,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and above all Meaningful Education and Universal Basic Income that truly lifts people out of Poverty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We Are The People,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we outgrew borders long ago, we are One Family on a Lonely Blue Earth.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We must learn to catch up with what is worthy of knowing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we can use Science, or Love, or both, or the Leading Edge of Instinct powered by our Humanity.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But we must continue building this world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">each generation must make improvements and never stop.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Those who stand in power today,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are to soon gracefully surrender to the better wisdom of the new generation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To preside is to wisely wait whilst the new generation becomes worthy of the position,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and to quietly step down, and put whatever wisdom was discovered to the books of history.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To preside, means not, to continue repeating mistakes because they are on the books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and therefore one will not be punished.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are only two sides to history, and only fools think it is the winning and the losing one,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the two sides as seen by future generations is the Wrong One, and The Noble One.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us all rise to the challenges of wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and making lasting and meaningful contributions to the Human Family.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us not be lost to the wrong side,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">let us not be passed over by the books of history,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">let us help wisdom propagate.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us stand up to every corner and every challenge,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and let us speak out against the wrong, the mistakes, the incomplete, the unfinished.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us not accept half measures, or good enough, or status quo,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or the lowest common denominator minimums that get commited to law books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us remember who we are,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and how Noble The Human Being.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us stand upright,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in Authenticity, Dignity, Wisdom and Compassion.</div>
