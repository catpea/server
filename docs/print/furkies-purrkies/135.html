  <p>I dreamt I was tumbling through time,</p>
  <p>and I had no control over which fragments I see.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>There was a mother writing a letter to a famous movie star,</p>
  <p>she was asking him to stop making movies, because her boy didn&apos;t comeback from war.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And it worked,</p>
  <p>and she wrote many letters.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>There was a lot of shocked artists and actors,</p>
  <p>they had no idea how they shaped young impressionable minds.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Boys wanted to go to real war,</p>
  <p>to be like the imaginary heroes they saw on TV.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And then I struggled in my dream, because my bullies were clearly ill, they were not all there,</p>
  <p>but World&apos;s Systems of Justice do not differentiate between the ill and the healthy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And so a person made permanently ill in their mind by poverty,</p>
  <p>is seen equal to a man of knowledge, insight, intelligence.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But the ill have little freedom of choice,</p>
  <p>they need therapy, and safety, and good homes, and hope, and dreams.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>To punish someone who couldn&apos;t grow up, didn&apos;t know to learn,</p>
  <p>for something that they weren&apos;t sure they were doing,</p>
  <p>and then to send them to a hopeless place without a hope of healing,</p>
  <p>without any hope of rehabilitation... is wrong.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>If they can&apos;t walk among us, if they are permanently ill,</p>
  <p>then build special schools for them, schools that bring hope.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We mustn&apos;t punish them more than life already had,</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2tOp7OxyQ8">our humanity depends on everyone&#x2019;s humanity</a>.</p>

  <p>And I saw Mr. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6IKu2wgm5I">Pirsig</a> on his motorcycle with his boy,</p>
  <p>the wind in his face representing the cutting edge of reality.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>He was worried that his Metaphysics is not real philosophy,</p>
  <p>it was not going to be taken seriously.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The answers they discovered on road they traveled and experiences they shared,</p>
  <p>created the Body of Knowledge that provided them with the forward momentum they needed to move ahead.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I dreamt that Pirsig was just talking bout Authenticity, Nobility and Dignity,</p>
  <p>and Knowledge and Wisdom, and Wise Intuition.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>He is unafraid to show us how vulnerable Philosophers are,</p>
  <p>that all it takes is ideas worth sharing, once or twice.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Anybody can be a philosopher,</p>
  <p>we will each be heard.</p>

  <p>All these strange fragments added together - to remind us that the World is Not Static,</p>
  <p>that it grows, moves, changes, and cares not to stop for things writ on paper.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Advancements in Psychology... the trailer to the movie about Philip Zimbardo work - alone,</p>
  <p>should invalidate laws and behaviors previously thought acceptable.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Humanity must grow, our cultures must drive us all forward,</p>
  <p>we must never assume that the world we are born into is a masterpiece.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And we must never let ourselves think,</p>
  <p>that others are in charge - it is our world, it belongs to us all.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>To make informed decisions,</p>
  <p>we require knowledge, wisdom, foresight, insight, a sense of belonging.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Without knowledge, we will not be able to see right from wrong,</p>
  <p>nor will any of our decisions do our elder selves justice.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Access to well grounded knowledge is not difficult,</p>
  <p>internet lectures - alone - may even suffice, but best selling non fiction audio books solve it completely.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Humanity must not fall behind on growing up,</p>
  <p>the longer the delay the greater the injustice.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Read and Listen to you books, my Friends,</p>
  <p>inherit the lifetimes of knowledge within.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We can&apos;t send people to prison without any hope of rehabilitation,</p>
  <p>for uninformed decisions that came on a whim.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And we can&apos;t allow mere Practice of Law without Functional Rehabilitation,</p>
  <p>and above all Meaningful Education and Universal Basic Income that truly lifts people out of Poverty.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>We Are The People,</p>
  <p>we outgrew borders long ago, we are One Family on a Lonely Blue Earth.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We must learn to catch up with what is worthy of knowing,</p>
  <p>we can use Science, or Love, or both, or the Leading Edge of Instinct powered by our Humanity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But we must continue building this world,</p>
  <p>each generation must make improvements and never stop.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Those who stand in power today,</p>
  <p>are to soon gracefully surrender to the better wisdom of the new generation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>To preside is to wisely wait whilst the new generation becomes worthy of the position,</p>
  <p>and to quietly step down, and put whatever wisdom was discovered to the books of history.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>To preside, means not, to continue repeating mistakes because they are on the books,</p>
  <p>and therefore one will not be punished.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>There are only two sides to history, and only fools think it is the winning and the losing one,</p>
  <p>the two sides as seen by future generations is the Wrong One, and The Noble One.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Let us all rise to the challenges of wisdom,</p>
  <p>and making lasting and meaningful contributions to the Human Family.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Let us not be lost to the wrong side,</p>
  <p>let us not be passed over by the books of history,</p>
  <p>let us help wisdom propagate.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Let us stand up to every corner and every challenge,</p>
  <p>and let us speak out against the wrong, the mistakes, the incomplete, the unfinished.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Let us not accept half measures, or good enough, or status quo,</p>
  <p>or the lowest common denominator minimums that get commited to law books.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Let us remember who we are,</p>
  <p>and how Noble The Human Being.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Let us stand upright,</p>
  <p>in Authenticity, Dignity, Wisdom and Compassion.</p>
