      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The Terrible Truth Behind Piano Keys, Scales, Schools and Uneducated Politicians</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">People are tricked into thinking that music theory is required for making music,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and schools deliver music theory as a single indivisible blob.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">With modern schools focusing on standardized testing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">schools trick kids into thinking that memorization is a kind of learning.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But memorization is only about keeping the grade point average high enough,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for everyone who works for that school to get paid.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">From the teacher's perspective,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they are doing their job, so that they can get paid.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">From the student's perspective,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they are trying to get good grades to get into good college, and get a good job.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But, we have to stop and ask,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is the school teaching, are the children learning?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Children can't tell the schools are bad for them,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because they do not know enough about life, and they tend to follow directions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Adults have the same problem with politics,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">politicians are actors that act just enough to get what they personally want.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It only takes a few liars to disable a nation,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but what we are seeing, is that here are only few honest people there.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">From the perspective of the politician, they serve their people,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and it is their job to inspire their trust.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">From a psychologists perspective,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that is lying.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I wonder where all the psychologists are,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with each passing decade their rise to their spotlight becomes more and more critical.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Most of us hear "C Major", or "C Minor",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that is just code for saying that we will start with the note C, and then focus on a pattern of notes named Major.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A scale is,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a pallet of 8 colors that the musician has chosen to compose with.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In painting colors are super important,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you really want to get the right yellow and orange to paint a sunrise, you have to mix them just right.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And just imagine the importance of colors when it comes to painting a portrait,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a starting artist may wish for a pre-mixed set of colors for just painting portrait - it sounds as useful as it is.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That is what a scale is,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a selection of pre-mixed notes so that a person can focus on making melodies.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That is the very least we need to take away from music class,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that is all it takes to give us the ability to express ourselves with music.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If children are forced to take tests, that obscure this gift of self-expression,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">its simplicity, glory, reward, empowerment, then they are being cheated.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If someone was to sit you down at a piano,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that had a knob that would let you choose from <span>all the scales<sup>[1]</sup></span> and highlight the keys of a selected scale.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You would immediately find a selection of notes that would match your feelings,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and begin composing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Listen, this is true, you only get eight keys,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you can only go up and down, and at a pace that fits your feeling, there is nothing difficult about this.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">More than that, you would be playing the soul of the song,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with sounds that connect with your feelings.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And then you would be called to add another layer,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a melody to bring light and wisdom to that world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And again, if we continue tolerating politicians that split their heads in two,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">one being I must act to appear amazing, and two being I must take care of my own business first - the world will not grow.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">World's politicians bifurcating is probably to a considerable degree,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">influenced by the in-authenticity they are forced to participate in schools.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are scaring the children that if they don't memorize,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they will be held back and called stupid.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are preventing children from learning,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by sending them to memorization and meat processing plants.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Humanity will not progress,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if this continues.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The saddest thing of all is that children think they are learning</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by passing all the tests, they call it learning, they know it as learning.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If memorization is ever taken away from them,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they will protest that education is being stolen.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Some kids do figure out they can't be creative,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and must instead perform this ritual of memorization - I think most of them still think of the ritual as learning.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When other kids hear of this ritual sacrifice, they see it as madness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in their minds it sounds like you can't be creative after you get good grades from music class.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Children are trying to figure this out,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but they can't, they don't have enough experience.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To the person who senses that they must sacrifice their unique creativity to get good grades,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we must say, "If you do that, then our world will die.".</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What makes a person unique and creative, must be protected and developed,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">destroying that, with stress, threats of being held back, creates the surface for liars to thrive in.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A liar is after all, is a perfectly uneducated and hollow individual,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">skilled in in getting everything, anyway.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To the person who says that learning music or science in school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">gives us the ability to be creative.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have to say, no,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we have to end this illusion.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The illusion of education by means of memorization and mediocrity, and cramming, and pretending,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because, again, that only creates a surface for big fat white lice to feed on the future of this world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have to to explain to this obviously intelligent individual,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that school is only holding him back.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It will come as shock at first, but that is not such a bad thing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because this shock will awaken a healthy skepticism that they are likely to employ in all their decision making.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Kids are are protecting a system of education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that did nothing for us.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Everything up to high school is working out nicely,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is when the subject divisions and tests that force memorization are introduced that education ends, and pretending begins.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Children don't pretend because they want to be actors,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but because it is impossible to graduate with a good GPA and still learn for real.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A teacher would make a fair point here and state that they have to rely on a separate entity to build the curriculum,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it does make sense that a teacher should receive help with structuring their lectures and semesters.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">While they already know much of what they will teach,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they still need structure.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But, like with that intelligent student that we have to say no to,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we must say no to the teachers as well.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No one but the student is allowed to structure the material,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it must be structured in a way that keeps them going, keeps them interested and passionate about their next steps.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The new curriculum should be based on a body of knowledge created by all the worlds students,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but the path must honor their uniqueness and existing creativity, must match their existing knowledge, and pace of learning.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Both politics and education can be greatly improved with interactive visualizations and info-graphics,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">just like a student should know where their path will take them, a voter should be able to see and comprehend the results of their vote.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Students should not be graded, they are still learning life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and in the new schools they will be learning the correct things at the correct pace.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But politicians, do need grades once they begin serving,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">furthermore the voters should base a lot of their decisions on the unique history of the politician's education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A decades long open and ongoing history of curiosities and achievements built by a political candidate in the new school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will prevent liars from entering positions that are meant for the true leaders of future generations.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A musical scale is just a selection of a few colors that the musician pre-selected, to paint their feelings with,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in a song they sat down to compose.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A real school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">would make you a musician in the course of a day.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are meant to learn for real, knowledge that results in wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and wisdom, that if we choose, will take us to greatness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us take no sides when it comes to Future of Humanity,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we are but temporary keepers of this world as it belongs to all the future generations - there is no place for in-authenticity here.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us say no, to make believe education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and let us say no to uneducated actors in roles of self serving leadership.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us honor all the future generations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by creating real schools that provide meaningful and personalized education.</div>
