  <p>We all start with a Great Dignity, and Great Nobility,</p>
  <p>we are full of genius and imagination, and impossible dreams.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We have to take good care for that,</p>
  <p>and use our Dignity and Nobility to transcend all limits, and beyond.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>There is a very tiny probability,</p>
  <p>that we maybe all the intelligence and impossible dreams that the universe has ever seen.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Either way, we are royals, we are special and beyond impossible,</p>
  <p>our ability to learn, to out-learn, to out-think, to abstract, is infinite.</p>

  <p>We created these little schools that double as babysitters, and distractions,</p>
  <p>but we need to make them second to our real education.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And our real education comes from about a thousand books we pick on our own,</p>
  <p>and listen and read to throughout our entire life, noting must interfere with that.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>You just need to take one step to get the taste for wisdom,</p>
  <p>listen to top ten adventure and travel and or hiking or jogging audio books.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The way your spirit grows from taking part in other peoples adventure,</p>
  <p>will show you, by subtle analogy, what the countless other steps will help you become.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A wise and great being, adventurer, some kind of an amazing genius,</p>
  <p>and a beacon of hope, and light of inspiration, and love.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The lessons you choose with your own heart and mind,</p>
  <p>are far more important than the lessons others are trying to make you cram for.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Books will grant you wisdom that will help you avoid regrets,</p>
  <p>they will enhance your decision making and long term visions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Books belong to you,</p>
  <p>their wisdom is your intellectual inheritance.</p>
