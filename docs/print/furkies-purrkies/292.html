    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Real Education</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Mistakes and Misunderstandings divide Humanity today,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">noting can be done because varying levels of education interfere with unity.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One of the biggest mistakes is ineffective education</div>
  <div class="paragraph">tricking students into believing that they are educated.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Mis-education, fake education, ineffective education makes us blind,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">truths and facts are drowned in an ocean of conflicting and equally wrong opinions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real education, is the key to unity, to a common grasp on reality,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but all the roads there are obscured by confused and confusing chatter.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is not until we accept the responsibility for our own education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that we will start learning, for real.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The biggest mistake is borders,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">groups of wealthy uneducated people coming together to decide the futures of their nations.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">These men claim greatness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and hold up their experience as their proof.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But experience is no substitute for wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">on the surface experience makes a person indistinguishable from a wise one.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The first clue to distinguish the two, is found in length of vision,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when they get around to speaking of problems of today, they will give excuses that they know - from experience - will hold up.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But they will dismiss the future entirely,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because to speak of the future; a person needs a direction, a vision, an objective, a purpose, a wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Men of experience, are too small minded, too blind and limited, to shallow, to fragile,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to see into things that have no impact on them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our levels of education are insufficient to directly address the problems that we face today,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there are too few well educated, knowledgeable and wise beings to repair anything right now.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">An uneducated voting majority is all to easily swayed and misled,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and our poverty will prevent our generation from re-learning.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One of the worst things about general poverty,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is that it induces a poverty of mind, out of lack of time, out of stress, fear, and discomfort.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Reality, has no borders, as climate change and pandemics show us,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in reality we are one human family.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And in reality, poverty is tearing the world apart,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is keeping us weak.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In reality, a teenager in a dictatorship on the other side of the world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is your friend, they would love you if you sent them popular snacks from your city, some photos and music.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They are family,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there are people out there who would be genuinely kinder to you than some of your own family.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is sooooo sad that we label each other with the names of our nations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and return to tend to whatever poverty we are facing at the moment.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Internet, student exchange, programs like Peace Corps,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and documents like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights help us see in our confused state.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But it is just a tiny sliver of light,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">poverty of mind alone is almost unaffected by it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">United Nations has its hands tied,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">without an appropriate level of education General Assembly will stand in a constant state of disagreement.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Without a plan to unite, and eliminate poverty,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we are all equally wrong.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And we can't have Unity and Prosperity without Knowledge and Wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">liars would instantly invent something that they stand to lose, and tear the world right up.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do you hear me, do you see what I am saying,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we are one, it is all of us, or none.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The way to fix it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is by inventing educational programs that really help children to knowledge, wisdom and greatness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Because until we hold long term visions fueled by Knowledge and Wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the only thing we can agree on, is what the liars want us to believe in.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real education is the thing that leads us to have thoughts independent to what is on TV and in News Papers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it helps us see who the liars, and mark my words for this sorry year, even when they assume a pleasing shape.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real Education grants us Intellectual Independence,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">where audio book by book we all independently gain a valid grasp on reality.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Organized education will always bend under the threat of being defunded or kept in poverty,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it will help to invent brand name institutions that are only better in the name, but all equally ineffective.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Organized education will rip talent out of children, it will sand it down until they are all equally lost,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">mixed with poverty most parents won't even be granted the ability to care about what is happening to the minds of their children, because the babysitting is good.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Organized education ends up causing harm to children's intellectual development,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it holds them back and causes so much stress that it is impossible to learn.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Organized education is such a problem, that even the best minds of our generations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are still thinking about "Free College" - about paying those fraudulent institutions - instead of funding ones that are capable of Real Education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Things are pretty bad, thankfully, we are infinite in our capacity to deal with real dangers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">especially the ones that tear tear our family apart.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real education is based on students' predispositions,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and curiosities.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For example, when someone is interested in the moon or stars at night,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that marks an entry point into Science Fiction, Astrophysics, Astrography and if they continue to care, Optics, Mathematics, Physics, Writing and so on.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Most children won't care for stars very long, because they are interested in exploring all of the universe,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and that is even better because then there is a multitude of passage ways they can use to walk through the sciences.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But it has to be their own walking, their own direction, and at their own pace,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we have to honor their predispositions and curiosities, the students are the future.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We have to remove grades, tests, graduation, class rooms, time divisions, subject divisions, rows of seats, groupings of any kind be it age or area of study,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we have to replace the teacher with personalized learning and tutors.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And we have to give the students what they need, a telescope, a fast single board computer with all the sensors and servos they could ever need,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they need the ability to launch satellites, to operate small remotely operated submarines and small drones, they need access to things they are curious about.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If a student is walking the wrong path, then it is a path that has been been walked many times before, they are asking a question, and they need powerful answers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they have to see what war is like, what prisons are like, what concentration camps are like - and what love is like - and they will learn.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">At the time of writing this in 2020, I realized that there are three nations that operate concentrations camps,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">which is probably to say, that there are many; and they need to see that too.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They need to see gang violence, and if they are still around then meet up with Father Gregory Boyle's boys,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for they have surely become Great Beings.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Nothing goes wrong in real education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">real education is about reality, about really growing up, and really being human.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And when these students grow up, become voters, Senators and Congresswomen and Congressmen,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then the liars, and pretenders, will lose their hold on humanity.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And then the members of General Assembly of United nations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">can finally have their day, in agreement and unity.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My friends,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">never lose hope.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If something important can't happen today,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it only means that you are to begin building the bridge, for others to eventually get there.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real Education is the first step,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the second is actually many overlapping steps that will happen all at once, all around the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">What you have to do is make sure that the students get to own or hold in their own hands the many tools that they need,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to learn, and explore the Human Condition, and The Sciences, and The World, and The Stars; as those are their countless bookmarks and the steppingstones to their boundless steps.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The children want to learn,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and that is all the hope Humanity will ever need.</div>
