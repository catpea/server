    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Schools Are Sus!</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Without reading powerful books written by wise beings,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">all we can really do is come up with half-baked conspiracy theories.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Does High School work?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or does it destroy creativity, uniqueness, and self esteem.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Does college work?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Or is everyone participating in a mutually beneficial dog an pony show?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Are we supposed to just get a job? or or build a career?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And what about Start-ups and Entrepreneurship and Invention?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">These questions matter, if you are in highs school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and high school isn't working, or working out...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Then what actually is going on,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is that you are falling behind on knowledge and wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is not that high school becomes easy or irrelevant when it is ineffective,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but that all this knowledge that would give you more insight into the world, is stolen from you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Without that empowering knowledge;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a good grasp on the human condition, a good intuition for liars, manipulators and cheaters.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Without being well grounded in reality, we'll be forced into desperation,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">into confusion, and all to easily swayed from the paths that we want to walk on.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">With a real education, you can operate an online business,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or write software, or become an art fanatic and illustrator without any upfront investment.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You gain so much support from what you can do,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that poverty ceases to be frightening, and you are allowed to develop further.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In school we face this notion of grades and GPA that somehow belittles us,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and then we are led through a standardized education under the banner of balance.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A musician has little interest in biology beyond what a pleasant to read book provides,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in the world of grades it can only distract and hurt, and interrupt their self education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And yet it appears, that grades exist primarily for getting more funding,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and they are fake, vague, and likely artificially manipulated to show progress.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Participating in nonsense,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">can only beget more nonsense.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is exhausting to try to figure all this out.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But think of a religious college, that puts science second to their particular religion,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">think of a diploma mill, and all the colleges that ended up losing accreditation for questionable practices.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Think about all the happy students, all the hard working teachers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">all the nice ladies that made little jokes and loved the students they worked with.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And consider this,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The most complex of lies exist not just simply for gains,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but also because it is highly impossible or cost prohibitive to prove wrong doing, and down right impossible to prove ill intent.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No university professor ever receives an email about now being able to pawn his loose-leaf "books" on the students,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">no dean ever asks the professors to let the students cram so that the college can keep their averages high and their accreditation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">These things are implied, assumed, and above all,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">part of the very foundation of a for-profit-non-profit that has lobbied not to forgive student loans due to bankruptcy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is only one way to answer these questions,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and that is to listen to and perhaps read five to fifteen books on each of these subjects.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We must not allow ourselves to be misled into a life of un-education, and desperation,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a school that can't provide results better, than you listening to a few dozen audio-books on some fantastic adventure, is worthless.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The first few years after school should be about us trying to build our own businesses,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to see is there is perhaps something better than being overworked for the rest of our lives.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Entrepreneurship is not something that we can memorize,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">ideas behind our undertakings have to come from our hearts and souls.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We need a real education for it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if school is not helping us to our independence, then we must switch to self education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Years go by pretty quickly when we aren't progressing forward,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and life has a way of getting ahead of us and challenging us with complexity.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I can't tell you is schools work or not,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">though I am certain that education is life long.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And I can't pick your books for you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because only you know the questions that call to you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But I know that books and especially narrated books and video lectures, that you arrange in a sequence that agrees with you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and watch at the pace that works best for you, are a powerful way to gain knowledge and to step ever closer to wisdom, and without any distractions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We owe it to ourselves to find books that help us away from mediocrity,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and help us inherit lifetimes of functional wisdom towards authenticity and independence.</div>
