  <p>We can&apos;t have a standardized education,</p>
  <p>because that would require a standardized life.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A life in which we are only passionate about</p>
  <p>what we are told to be passionate about.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A life, where memorization,</p>
  <p>does suffice.</p>

  <p>My friends, the standardization of your existence,</p>
  <p>is something that every lazy teacher, evil C.E.O., mad dictator, cult leader, and crooked politician dreams about.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A standardized existence is one</p>
  <p>where your mind is taken from you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Just like you recoil at the thought of a standardized breakfast,</p>
  <p>the words standardized education should make you feel sick!</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>Even if you could learn by being taught like a little bird is fed,</p>
  <p>how could you allow someone to pick the knowledge for your mind?</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Allowing someone to insert standardized lessons into your mind is disgusting,</p>
  <p>you are a unique and sacred being, born a genius and meant to be driven to wisdom and greatness.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You are meant to be the hope and dreams of all the past generations,</p>
  <p>school, job, career, retirement and some promise of world travel is not how real life works.</p>

  <p>The people in charge of creating early schools might not have had the opportunity</p>
  <p>to create schools that are capable of inspiring the students to great heights.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Since, we have only updated that imperfect first attempt at mass education,</p>
  <p>we lost the original dream of helping the world become Knowledgeable and Wise.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Today, teachers create cookie cutter lessons and matching tests,</p>
  <p>that they expect you to cram for, in what has now become a Mockery of Real Education.</p>

  <p>Standardization is evil and dangerous, it shows a total misunderstanding of the Human Condition,</p>
  <p>it is a dangerous waste of time, that often destroys joy, uniqueness, talent, and other colorful predispositions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Teachers can only help students to books,</p>
  <p>they need to focus on creating and recording quality video lectures.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The greatest education that can be given to student is one afforded by student exchange programs,</p>
  <p>beyond that it must be a path they pick; by choosing the materials that interest them.</p>

  <p>A standardized education does not have enough depth to help the student grow,</p>
  <p>it can only slow them down and restrict them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>An ordinary teacher is one, even a classroom and school is one,</p>
  <p>and cannot reach a unique student in a way that they are ready for.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But copies of video lectures, audio books, interactive games, and books,</p>
  <p>can! reach every student, and just at the right place in their development.</p>

  <p>The world is changing at an increasingly faster pace,</p>
  <p>the brittle ideas behind original standardized education never quite lived up to their promise.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Let us work towards replacing standardized education</p>
  <p>with life-long personalized education.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Education that drives a student to Authenticity, Knowledge, Independence, Entrepreneurship, and Wisdom,</p>
  <p>and not the curse of an uninspired existence born of broken promises, fear, doubt, uncertainty, and depression.</p>
