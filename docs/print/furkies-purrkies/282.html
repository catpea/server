    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Standardized Education</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We can't have a standardized education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because that would require a standardized life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A life in which we are only passionate about</div>
  <div class="paragraph">what we are told to be passionate about.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A life, where memorization,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">does suffice.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My friends, the standardization of your existence,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is something that every lazy teacher, evil C.E.O., mad dictator, cult leader, and crooked politician dreams about.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A standardized existence is one</div>
  <div class="paragraph">where your mind is taken from you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just like you recoil at the thought of a standardized breakfast,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the words standardized education should make you feel sick!</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even if you could learn by being taught like a little bird is fed,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">how could you allow someone to pick the knowledge for your mind?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Allowing someone to insert standardized lessons into your mind is disgusting,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you are a unique and sacred being, born a genius and meant to be driven to wisdom and greatness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are meant to be the hope and dreams of all the past generations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">school, job, career, retirement and some promise of world travel is not how real life works.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The people in charge of creating early schools might not have had the opportunity</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to create schools that are capable of inspiring the students to great heights.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Since, we have only updated that imperfect first attempt at mass education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we lost the original dream of helping the world become Knowledgeable and Wise.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Today, teachers create cookie cutter lessons and matching tests,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that they expect you to cram for, in what has now become a Mockery of Real Education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Standardization is evil and dangerous, it shows a total misunderstanding of the Human Condition,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is a dangerous waste of time, that often destroys joy, uniqueness, talent, and other colorful predispositions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Teachers can only help students to books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they need to focus on creating and recording quality video lectures.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The greatest education that can be given to student is one afforded by student exchange programs,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">beyond that it must be a path they pick; by choosing the materials that interest them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A standardized education does not have enough depth to help the student grow,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it can only slow them down and restrict them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">An ordinary teacher is one, even a classroom and school is one,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and cannot reach a unique student in a way that they are ready for.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But copies of video lectures, audio books, interactive games, and books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">can! reach every student, and just at the right place in their development.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The world is changing at an increasingly faster pace,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the brittle ideas behind original standardized education never quite lived up to their promise.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let us work towards replacing standardized education</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with life-long personalized education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Education that drives a student to Authenticity, Knowledge, Independence, Entrepreneurship, and Wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and not the curse of an uninspired existence born of broken promises, fear, doubt, uncertainty, and depression.</div>
