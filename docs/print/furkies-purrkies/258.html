  <p>When you drive long enough,</p>
  <p>you will inevitably find yourself far away from everything.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Now, you have to be courageous,</p>
  <p>as first few days are going to be filled with doubt.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Once you get through it,</p>
  <p>and the daily stresses let go of you, you will become you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And if you give it long enough,</p>
  <p>you&apos;ll find yourself wondering how you got here.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The answer is almost always,</p>
  <p>&quot;By making excuses for people, that didn&apos;t deserve them.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>This falls back on judging people by that age,</p>
  <p>and not by their wisdom, class, and maturity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Anybody can age,</p>
  <p>but the pursuit of wisdom is a great challenge.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Just as soon as you stop making excuses,</p>
  <p>as you stop filling in the blanks, you are placed on a path towards wisdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>While you do need your books,</p>
  <p>and narrated books are best, the journey is also very important.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You can&apos;t hear the wisdom of a book,</p>
  <p>until you get on that path.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And let me precisely state what that path is,</p>
  <p>so that there is no room for confusion here.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is,</p>
  <p>The Path Of Adventure.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I was sitting in my coffee shop,</p>
  <p>I went there because it once had Tolstoy on the bookshelves.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But, I&apos;ve noticed that things have changed,</p>
  <p>and people were not growing up, they were running in circles, curving inwards.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I sat in the rocking chair,</p>
  <p>it was the first time, it felt nice.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I rose,</p>
  <p>and made it to Tennessee.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I could feel the Spirit of Adventure,</p>
  <p>but there was this enormous responsibility to help people grow.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I was too young to be heard,</p>
  <p>though I have a faint memory of someone calling me Mother Hen somewhere.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Georgia, I made it to Georgia next,</p>
  <p>but instead of turning around, I slept at a rest area.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I woke up, and kept going,</p>
  <p>until the highways I was on, turned to US Highway One.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I pulled up by the beautiful beach,</p>
  <p>and I walked into the Amazing and warm Ocean.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Standing On The Edge Of The Universe,</p>
  <p>I called it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It was wonderful,</p>
  <p>the stars came out, I&apos;ve noticed little glowy fishes swimming about.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>On my way pack,</p>
  <p>I shout right past my city, and kept on driving.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And yet again I ended up on another beach,</p>
  <p>this time in Ludington, Michigan.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Here I overheard someone mention,</p>
  <p>Nordhouse Dunes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I set off immediate, I&apos;ve never seen dunes that big before,</p>
  <p>they looked like mountains, to me.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I begun sleeping at a different campsite each day,</p>
  <p>then I discovered a little dune that reminded me of a volcano.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And I have spent many days there,</p>
  <p>I have listened to many audio books on top of my little volcano.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I discovered how much there is to wisdom,</p>
  <p>and what is more, that most of our wisdom has to come from within us.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Daily stresses, and unimportant worries,</p>
  <p>trying to speak to people who never listen, is not healthy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Before we try to help others grow,</p>
  <p>we must become wise, and much, much older.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>People must be ready to listen,</p>
  <p>before they can hear and comprehend what you are sharing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Express your concern for others,</p>
  <p>but not by being pulled into problems of people that don&apos;t listen.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Write, and narrate your books, write to those who are searching for wisdom,</p>
  <p>and you will be heard and adored the world over.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Now, go set off on your beautiful adventure,</p>
  <p>may you discover all the wisdom and fathom more.</p>
