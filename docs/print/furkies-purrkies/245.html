    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Myths were invented to describe amazing people,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and I've seen many amazing creatures in my journeys.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One time out in Nordhouse,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">out of nowhere popped out a freshly graduated engineer.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">He held up a gallon water container that was carrying back to camp,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the poor mad lad uttered, "8.34 pounds".</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">He seemed excited, but also sad,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and I think he was acting so odd because he realized he was forgetting everything.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Plus, I am certain he said pounds,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">not kilograms; mad in deed.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Another time, at 6am or so, I was going through maps of south Pacific,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in Ann Arbor, by that strange black metal cube sculpture that squeaks when rotated.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I just had to get away from Ambrosia's morning clientele,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">bless their hearts.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And I've noticed that across the park some student was sleeping under an evergreen,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I don't think she worked in US, I just somehow assumed South America, Amazon.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">She stared getting off the ground, and tried to yell that she wasn't homeless or drunk,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I kept looking into my maps, ignoring her; and she went on her way to get a grant, or give a speech or something.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I am sure she worked in South America,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">probably with the natives.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Over in Ludington, there was this one time a little girl was feeding Seagulls with her mom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and just as I noticed the commotion...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">one of the Seagulls,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">went, all, out!</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Right in her hair,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I felt so bad, and her mother was only barely able to contain her laughter.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">She puffed up her face as if playing a trumpet,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you could totally tell she had enough of that kid, and she was getting payback for all her hissy fits.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And then there is this... story that is most Dearest to me,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">one of my happiest memories, that I swore I would never talk about because I am far too mature.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Alas, this is what All Hallows' Eve is all about,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">talking about strange creatures, and wonderful memories.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It was an beautiful early morning,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was sitting by my breakfast fire.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Mostly listening to birds, and probably angry bears,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">whilst squiggling in my journal, about poems, and programs.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This was a large and beautiful camp site full of tress,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they had clean showers, and proper restrooms.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I had the <span>first camp site on the Orchid Loop<sup>[1]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and I noticed that a couple of giggly middle aged ladies were <span>just getting into the spirit of camping<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They were always happy, and sophisticated,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and laughing, playing some smart radio station, and always full of joy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This morning the tall one started shimmy shammying first,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">she was probably getting around to starting up a fire to make breakfast.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They had all the firewood,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and swe was singing something, it was unusual for people to make so many happy little noises during a stay there.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">She quieted down a bit,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and lit her fire.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And as she bent over to pick up some twigs to get things going,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">she fired off that old familiar sound that one would expect from a constipated and uncultured, filthy, lactose intolerant old man.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And, oh my gosh,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">all of a sudden all the birds went quiet.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It was just this unusual deafening silence,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and that's just half the story, because all of a sudden this sophisticated wealthy woman goes:</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <h3>"Puull my finga"</h3>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In the worst fake southern accent she could possibly conjure up,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and with the longest drawl.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And then she quickly skedaddled back to her camper,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">- probably to change, and lay down a bit.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This must have been ten years ago or more,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and I still haven't forgotten about it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Happy Halloween,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Everyone.</div>
