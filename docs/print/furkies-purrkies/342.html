    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Hundreds Of Good Books and Decades Of Good Decisions</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You need knowledge from books to expand your view of the world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you need to know more, you need hundreds of books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You need a view of the world that comes from the books you chose,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but is also correct as it balanced it self.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As it corrected it self, just out of the number of books that you listened,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and re-listened, and continue re-listening to.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I do not wish to concern you, but whatever you choose in life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">also choose to become an Independent Entrepreneur just in case.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Nobody knows the troublemakers that we will encounter in our future,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I once watched a very nice person invite a reporter to an event we were both volunteering in.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It later occurred to me, that he was collecting newspaper articles about him self,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for years in the future, when he needed a promotion.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I just had to look up nepotism,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and "legacy ivy".</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is not something an ordinary honest person can go up against,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">now with social media, people probably pay agencies for posts, original articles, probably vacation videos, even.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This kind of thing is too complex to fight,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and don't just assume that nepotism is about getting the job, because it may also be about people trying to push you out, to get you to quit.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Don't assume that this will happen to you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but don't assume that this will happen to somebody else.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Instead,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">slowly and calmly read and listen to your books and build up the knowledge required,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to swiftly build your own company, have a plan for giving away free services to build a group of happy customers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Understand that this is not just about a product you would like to make, or a service you would like to provide,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but mostly about customers that will reliably come to your product or service and gladly pay as they will honestly need it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And there is more,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you need to get in touch with your elder self.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Begin asking "What are your regrets?",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">just keep freaking asking that question until you whip yourself up out of whatever you are in, by your own shoelaces...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I don't know how to say this, you know that you need real knowledge, like functional knowledge,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">not just "performing on tests" like an actor, which is what school will give you, so that they can take a paycheck home.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real Knowledge is huge, you go home and start making stuff,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">sometimes stuff you didn't even know you could make, awesome.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But, then, wisdom will come to you, it happens, you get a good bull**t meter, and all your decision become good,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you will smile and feel joy, and make stuff like paintings of philosophers, and their happy quotes, or something, and change lives of people, for better, for happier.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Somehow.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But there is more,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because wisdom is something you hardly work for - I mean it comes to you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So, what happens when you make a move forward, or up, or both...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">...what happens?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think people observing someone taking that step,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">call it Greatness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I am sure no person making that step ever called it that,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but that is what others call it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And, I think that is where you need to go,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">discover your Knowledge, watch Wisdom Surround You, and then take that step.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Whatever it may be,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">others will call it Greatness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The results that come from taking that step,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are a very important part of your well-being, of the meaning of your life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When you finally become your elder self, and take a look back at your younger life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and probably still not be satisfied - I doubt anybody ever is.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But look at and feel that journey, and feel how heavy it was, how impossible those dreams,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you will understand how important it was to make it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Looking back all the big decisions you made,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">may still even seem scary, but you will greatly appreciate having that foresight, that knowledge, having found that balance.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A huge chunk of your accomplishments will come from enlarging your view with books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you'll feel it but may have difficulty pinpointing a set of books, it will just be having read many of them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Let me put it in a way that approaches a vision of it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">hundreds and hundreds of books, decades and decades of knowledgeable and wise decisions, and hundreds and hundreds more, and decades and decades more.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is impossible to arrive in a place that you feel uncomfortable in, when you just spend decades and decades,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and read hundreds and hundreds of books, slowly and slowly, slowly and wisely making your way forward.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Take your time, but remember, our life is very long, much longer than you will ever expect,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and that once you reach for real knowledge from real people who worked really had at it...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">...and carry on in some part with knowledge gained from them,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and from your beautiful life, and experiences as well.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are sure to become wise,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and then, you will be able to use that wisdom to help others.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And eventually make your elder self feel warm and cozy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">probably in their 80s and 90s, as they cheerfully shuffle around.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Hey, you can't be sure, so don't say know,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but they maybe painting something really beautiful, or typing on an ancient typewriter, to make it difficult to write the way I am writing right now.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">(Let me tell you, I already know what I am getting for my 90th birthday,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this is my third poem today, the other two were to long, I try very hard to keep under 130 lines.)</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Which brings us to the closing of this flight of poetic fancy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so let me just say it one more time, without mincing words, let me just say it:</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">BECOME A GREAT BEING</div>
