    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">The World Is Growing Up Faster And Faster</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Prisons should not exist,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">only schools and care facilities.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Money should not hold Humanity back,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it should help Humanity grow.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And at birth, every child should be granted a home,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and all the money they will ever need.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We should not tolerate broken ideas,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we should reject all that propagates them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The schools are broken,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">schools do not teach.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And one of the most important things for a student,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">must be exchange programs, each semester in a different part of the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I will forgo writing about the meaning of legal systems,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in cities that do nothing to prevent poverty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I won't write about Judges tolerating the difference between Fairness and Justice,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and what is in the law books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I will not mention the second part of the 13th amendment,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and what that makes us.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I am not going to discuss,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">tolerance of poverty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I won't write about tolerance of cults that erase curiosity,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and all the things they got away with especially when no one was looking.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I will clench my teeth and won't say a word about bad teachers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and their sick curricula.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I won't speak about bad parenting,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and arrogance.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I wasn't even going to talk about ineffective politics,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there is actually nothing to say on that subject, ZERO!</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I won't talk about hospitals turning a profit,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">from the sick and dying.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is hard not to talk about losing Tigers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but I can hold my tears back, I won't speak.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I won't mention the risks that have been taken with climate,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">pollution and plastics, deforestation, melting glaciers and ocean desolinization.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I won't speak of the Holocene extinction,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but I will mention it with anger.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I won't talk about vaccine hesitancy, though like racism and crime,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is just a basic function of lack of education and the impact that toxicity of poverty has on us.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are many more things that I won't speak of, human right violations, ongoing slavery in wealthy nations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">children in concentration camps in both US, and N.Korea looking to the moon and wondering if someone else is looking too, and can they hear their thoughts and feel their despair.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I will leave it up to you to notice all those terrible things,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in the noble course of your own self education, as you rise to become a grown up.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I just want you to know, that the reason why you can't understand the world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and why nobody has the answers that you need, is because nothing works.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Somethings do work sometimes,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but not always, not reliably, not for everyone, not equally.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is not to say that the world is a bad place,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but it is IN a bad place, a bad place in its history.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The one thing that has been consistent, that we can be sure of,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is that every day, more and more people notice more and more problems.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This increase of awareness has been going on for thousands of years,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and it cannot stop, it is just not possible.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There cannot exist any borders or nations sick enough to stop it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we are too complex, the world is too chaotic and connected.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Each day, we notice more and more broken things,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">each day there are more and more people in every village and city, of every nation, noticing more and more.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a miracle,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is incomplete, but it is a beginning it is a perfect and unerasable starting point for upcoming change.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The Global Change that will come out of nowhere,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as a function of our connectedness and the rejection of broken things.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When it finally happens,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">people, especially young people, will look back at our generations with disbelief.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In their culture,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the culture of Reason... Restraint, Dignity, Nobility, Unbreakability, Fortitude, Courage, Honor, Love;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and Insight; and Foresight; and Understanding; and Authenticity; and Heroism... and Compassion and Wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The way we are today will be very unclear to them,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">just like we can't understand bathing once a year, or living in caves...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They will be born to an integrated and truly modern world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that will make ours... far too strange.</div>
