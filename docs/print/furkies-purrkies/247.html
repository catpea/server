  <p>Wisdom is the substance with which Humanity grows,</p>
  <p>and it is also the might with which every hero rose.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>There cannot be a united world without a wise voter,</p>
  <p>systems of politics can&apos;t work like a motor.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Corruption comes out of most people wanting to appear smart,</p>
  <p>but their incompetence does not end when they depart.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Not only are they replaced by more of the same,</p>
  <p>but the policies they set continue wandering without an aim.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Systems as such expand until they seize and fall,</p>
  <p>then from the ashes can only rise a wall after wall.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is because pretenders when pressed can only pretend more,</p>
  <p>liars can only destroy a nation and lead it to war.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A nation must first help its uneducated, poor, and weak,</p>
  <p>because poverty prevents people from learning and makes the future bleak.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Then, to power a system the voter must be educated and wise,</p>
  <p>otherwise they can only contribute to the system&apos;s demise.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We cannot hope to build a peaceful nation,</p>
  <p>if we do not begin with functional and real education.</p>

  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">Cognitive biases</a> alone,</p>
  <p>will corrupt a politician down to the bone.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But their real curse is such,</p>
  <p>that they can&apos;t know, that they don&apos;t know very much.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Fake it until you make it, is not a driving force,</p>
  <p>it is a mode of being rotten at the source.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Alas, we are too beautiful to allow politicians to sell it all,</p>
  <p>we will turn our heads away from their madness and their fall.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A day will come, when they call for their wars,</p>
  <p>but we&apos;ll be too busy, tearing down walls, and opening windows, and doors.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The future generations should look towards the internet,</p>
  <p>building a world united by a peaceful mindset.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A world build far and above geographic borders,</p>
  <p>one that is connected by Education and Compassion, not just orders.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But, we cannot Unite - without Wisdom and Schools,</p>
  <p>today we do not yet have the necessary tools.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Non the less, the symbol of the Withe Dove,</p>
  <p>will continue waiting for Humanity to unite, in Wisdom and Love.</p>
