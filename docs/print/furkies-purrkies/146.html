    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The Philosophers attempt to bring ideas to the future generations,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they are masters of learning how to think, conceptualize, and get extremely smart.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are a few things that we must set aside at first,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and above all remember that they were children once, teenagers, that they are all too human.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When possible we should begin with survey courses and general overviews,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Video Lectures and Audio Books on the subject of Philosophy in general.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>The Story of Philosophy: The Lives and Opinions of the Greater Philosophers<sup>[1]</sup></span></div>
  <div class="paragraph">is a great start, Ariel and Will Durant seem like an amazing couple.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In 1977 they were presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Gerald Ford,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and Ariel was named "Woman of the Year" by the city of Los Angeles.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>The Giants of Philosophy Series<sup>[2]</sup></span> is a set of 13 Audio Books surveying word's top Philosophers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">written by multiple authors and narrated by Charlton Heston.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We must not judge a Philosophy by the mistakes of the Philosopher,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if they did make mistakes, then they published hoping to be granted a hearing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We should avoid memorizing, ideally we want to approach Philosophers that we find familiar,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and perhaps already having re-invented some portion of what they worked on.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">One concept that comes to mind is Amor Fati,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it means Love of Fate.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But to me, it does not speak about the kind of fate where everything is pre-determined,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or the fate of a person who lets whim and life push them around, but rather events that just happen.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Friedrich Nietzsche<sup>[3]</sup></span> wrote a great deal about <span>Amor Fati<sup>[4]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but in my opinion he takes it too far as he speaks of Suffering, he runs into the extremes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My bullies are an example of Extremes and Suffering,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and Amor Fati does not mean I should love my bullies, and Friedrich states as much:</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"Only great pain is the ultimate liberator of the spirit. I doubt that such pain makes us &#x2018;better&#x2019;; but I know that it makes us more profound."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(Thanks Friedrich, My Dear Old Friend.)</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Albert Camus brings it down to reality,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">speaking of accepting that life comes with Difficulty and Ease, and we should accept both.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"A will to live without rejecting anything of life... is the virtue I honor most in this world."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is not enough to learn <strong>about</strong> a philosophical concept like we just did,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we should hope to integrate it, or keep it as a reminder that we have more to learn before we understand it fully.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The way I connect with Amor Fati,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is by understanding that not everything in my life will happen for a reason,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">some thing will just happen out of complexity and randomness that we can't prevent; and that to me is fate.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I like how Albert Camus telks about Ease and Difficulty and the way I understand him,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is that we should stand up for what we believe in, even if it means that people will yell at us.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So it is not tolerance of difficult things that just happen for no reason,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but the difficulty of standing up for what we believe in when the chance presents it self, for no reason- you see.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Our decision making which dictates our path in life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">has nothing to do with things that happen for no reason.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Finally, Amor Fati simply means,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">do not let things that you have no control over take away from your Love of Life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">While this may not be exactly what Friedrich Nietzsche and Albert Camus talk about,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">my initial, more personal interpretation, gives me a platform from which I can learn both of their interpretations and mutual differences.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And what I am showing here, is that we don't have to understand all the philosophical concepts right away,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that it is best to learn a little bit at a time, at our own pace, and in our own sequence.</div>
</div>
