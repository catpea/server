      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Find A Library</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If the world had an enemy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">its greatest weapon would be the control of the level of knowledge,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and control of what is allowed to be known.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even without an enemy, we fall into the trap of unknowing, all on our own,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">..and we make, what we discover later on to be, wrong decisions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">While we are making those decisions,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we are certainly making them with goodness in mind,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but without knowledge, good intentions may indeed, pave a way to hell.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is something that has been known for thousands of years,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">control of what is known is the evil behind slavery,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is the evil behind manufactured consent.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And anything, that stands in the way of real education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">even broken schools, should be seen as an attack,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the theft of our intellectual inheritance.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Real Education must be seen as one of our Greatest Rights,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as a Great Treasure, a Great Honor, and Great Reward.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Failure to see that, is a sign that something has gone wrong,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and it is time to begin reading books on your own.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Be mindful of schools that are not educating you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">find your way to the library, read all the books that help you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">drop out, and carry on in Relentless Pursuit of Knowledge.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Know with full certainty,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that Dysfunctional Education, Neutered Education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Education that fails to help you become Wise,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and Education that Makes You Feel Trapped, of Stupid,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is Fake Education!</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is a trick</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that is robbing you of your right to knowledge and your path to greatness;</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Find A library, find the Philosophy Section,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and find your beloved books there.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In the absence of teachers, you become a teacher,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">learn, so that you may help others grow.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Humanity needs you to become a Great Being,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so that it too, can grow.</div>
