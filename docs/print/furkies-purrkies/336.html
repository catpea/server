      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">A Note On Learning Mathematics For Real</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Above all, you need a long-term reason to learn,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if you are not involved in a particular field, then you will learn nothing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is easy to make excuses for seemingly learning math,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You won't always have a calculator on hand" or "By memorizing the multiplication table you'll be able to calculate faster".</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That makes perfect sense, but that is not math,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that's just calculations, adding numbers, double-checking the change you get from a cashier.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The simple reasons for math, have little to do with math,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and always having a cool mini calculator on you, is pretty damn cool.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But <span>TI-83<sup>[1]</sup></span>, is not as cool as it looks on the surface,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for one it is overpriced, perhaps 10 times the price.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Supply and demand shouldn't apply to students,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">everything used in education from textbooks to laptops must be free.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So cooler than the TI-83, is a calculator you program yourself,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">preferably by means of a high level programming language, maybe even a Raspberry PI Zero.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And of course, you see where this is going,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by considering to program your own calculator you are teleported on the edge of the Great Canyon of Mathematics.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Now, every cool damn thing from Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Calculus, Engineering,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to Generative Art, Antikythera Mechanism, Even Kryptos-analysis-tools and Black Hole and Big Crunch stand right in front of you</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Softly mocking you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for not being cool, yet.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Sure, what is a TI-83 inspired Raspberry PI to you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when you are never going to use the engineering formulas you gather.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is almost a fair point,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but although we covered the reason for mathematics, we have not yet covered the reason for your reason.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Though it maybe hard to believe,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is not enough to just own the coolest calculator in the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You aren't supposed to pursue things for their own sake,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">every reason must have a reason.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So you celebrate the day you set your foot in High School or College,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by launching your first start-up.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Call it, Fair Instruments Incorporated, Model T-800,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and just sell a Calculator Kit based on Raspberry PI Zero, to be assembled by the customer.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is also something that requires that you get investors,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">keep the company small, don't work hard, work smart, your goal should be to become a great being, not a mere business person.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So now, not only are you plowing through math to build your first prototype,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but you are doing it to become a business person and exit poverty, you will certainly exit the stress of poverty.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As a bonus you could offer a distributed social network (by wirelessly connecting all the nearby Raspberry PI Zero W/s),</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and other projects like Collaborative Audio Book Recording, or a Synthesizer Cluster for a Collaborative School Symphony Orchestra.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You could run a <span>Beowulf Cluster<sup>[2]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or build a distributed search engine, the sky is not even the limit,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Perhaps that should be your starting point,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a Sky Net connecting all the schools together, and rebuilding education inside out by providing relevant and personalized lectures,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You see the importance of using High Level Programming Languages,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and a Standard Open Operating System... there are more lessons to be had.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">By going beyond a calculator, you leave the reality of simple mathematics,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and enter the world of Programming, Communications, Robotics, Distributed Networking.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Perhaps eventually, you may even design your own PI/s,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">maybe this time with an Open 5G Hat, Aural (as in Audio) Interface, and a phone network meshing all the schools together with free internet and voice.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You don't have to start big with your prototype,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The <span>PO-128<sup>[3]</sup></span> is a good lesson to learn from, their entire product line is a dream.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But use Linux, and High Level Programming Languages,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">do not limit yourself with with a micro-controller stick with general purpose operating systems that people can learn valuable lessons from.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you want to start learning math right now,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">create a start-up that generates <span>generative art<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is always a need for interesting video backgrounds,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and you can keep the company simple by just giving most of them them away.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is also the realm of <span>computer games<sup>[5]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">think: auto-playing computer games.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And the on ramp is not that complex, see <span>Snap SVG<sup>[6]</sup></span> and <span>P5<sup>[7]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and see if maybe you are more interested in 3D graphics, via <span>three.js<sup>[8]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In closing, you can't real things really well if you have no real use for them,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">whatever you study must be part of your existence, your life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And mathematics can easily become part of your life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if you take to a future of computer graphics, algorithms or even electronic devices.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A word of caution, those who are making you memorize so that you perform on tests like an actor,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">do not have your best interests in mind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Build your future</div>
  <div class="paragraph">- accept the responsibility for your own education.</div>
