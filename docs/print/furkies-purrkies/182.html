  <p>The Human Mind is beautiful,</p>
  <p>but as we grow, it requires upgrades, education, insights.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Philosophy, Love of Wisdom,</p>
  <p>the uncontradictory arrangement of thoughts which that represents,</p>
  <p>must constantly aim to correct, expand and refine it self.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Even while in pursuit of knowledge and finest thoughts,</p>
  <p>we will unfortunately inherit some mistaken observations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Philosophers often do their best work right on the edge of their very limits,</p>
  <p>they can&apos;t haul all their tools out there, they do their best, when they do their most.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We have to check their work, and should they mistaken,</p>
  <p>we have to come to their aid, and make repairs to their works.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>This is why me must constantly monitor what we are learning,</p>
  <p>even if the ideas come from people we are admire.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>In a word,</p>
  <p>we too have to become Philosophers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Philosophers and Great Beings aim to bring light to the world,</p>
  <p>light of Knowing and Knowledge, light for The Human Condition.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>They welcome repairs to their works,</p>
  <p>they hope, you will come to think with them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And they hope that You too,</p>
  <p>will become a Philosopher.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Wisdoms alter our decision making, sometimes reverse our opinions,</p>
  <p>we must learn, we must inherit all of the greatest wisdoms.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Without that education and inheritance,</p>
  <p>we can&apos;t be sure if the choices we are meaning are correct.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>In some cases - allegory of the cave, altered education, or just cheap propaganda,</p>
  <p>we can&apos;t even be sure if the opinions we hold dear are our own,</p>
  <p>or if they are simply effects of the facts that we have been allowed to learn and grow with.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Pursuit of Wisdom, in all its color, not only makes us wise,</p>
  <p>but it helps us become leaders, and pushes us away from the life of following.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>While becoming a Philosopher or a Great Being may seem optional today,</p>
  <p>ask your Elder Self,</p>
  <p>if being able to inspire the younger generation to Genius is something that you may wish for.</p>
