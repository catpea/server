  <div class="paragraph">The distance between Science and Play, between Adventurer and Scientist,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">approaches zero will approach zero in proportion to just how much fun you are having.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My first independent invention was a CD based Car MP3 player in 1998,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there were many other mp3 player patents, dating many years back, I didn't invent anything new.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My second invention about 10 year later, was a freaking star-ship,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and it was safe to teenagers fly.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It was a high altitude balloon with a miniature craft that would beam down video and movement of the platform,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to a trailer down on the ground where the crew would be experiencing all the motion in near real time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once the balloon pops it would be possible to the dismay of the FAA, and evey other three letter agancy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to attempt to stair it, the kids in the trailer on the ground would be getting real feedback to whatever the heck they were trying to do.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once someone slams the deploy parachute button,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the miniature craft would slow its descent, the trailer would shudder.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My third invention, from just not too far back was a board game,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but a fascinating one.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Amazon sells see through acrylic padlocks, and deadbolts for locksmith training,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and I realized that one could create a little game out of them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Basically the players would have to lock-pick their way through the game,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they would each receive a little lock picking kit, which is the real deal.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As a bonus the last door they would have to pick,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">was the door to their own house.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This would teach the players to find a quality lock,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and actually help them in real life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And just now, I am toying with the extremely CPU intensive post processing of photographs,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I was just able to bring color to an infrared photo taken in the middle of the night.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are no practical applications,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am just looking towards astrography, contemplating the milky way.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Toying with a program called <span>ZeroMQ<sup>[1]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is just meant to send information between programs and commuters,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but I can also see that it could control a large array of cameras and I am just wondering what that could mean for slow motion,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">super resolution, and things like home made supernovae detection software.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is all fun and games, I am hardly programming any of this, and it is all just about as unscientific as it can be,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but it does help with day dreams, having a bold idea, and looking into it, teaches something.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This kind of exploratory learning, or self education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if far more powerful than reading textbooks, or listening to lectures.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do not be afraid of imagining interesting things,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">take to the microscope, infrared and thermal imaging.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I think self education is the only way to make the world a better place,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">treat school for what it is, and don't let it stand between you and real knowledge, and fun.</div>
