  <p>My Friends,</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Not only are we unable to directly conjure up the greatest of our heights,</p>
  <p>in that they must ensue from our Greatness &amp; Pursuits.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But also,</p>
  <p>we can&apos;t see that which we will miss.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A mistake hidden within the heartbreaking realm of never knowing what we missed,</p>
  <p>an old, odd realm, strangely built with invisible walls.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The only way we can be sure that we have not fallen to some prison of invisible walls,</p>
  <p>is to keep moving forward and up, and never stop.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>If our elder selves, do end up, having regrets that begin with, &quot;I wish I knew...&quot;,</p>
  <p>then by pushing forward today, we let them know that we have done our Best.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We send a message of compassion to our future selves,</p>
  <p>late at night, at 3AM, the older you, will lay awake, and say:</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>&quot;I was amazing, there was noting else I could do...&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Our elder selves need to know that we lived boldly, courageously,</p>
  <p>it is for their health, and so that feel proud, and can get back to sleep with a smile.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I am always sad about never hearing about this from teachers,</p>
  <p>that our life is one, in many profound ways.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>That authenticity is not some ideal,</p>
  <p>but just another name for Health, for Sanity, for Strength.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>When we are older we realize that shortcuts are worthless,</p>
  <p>that they only lead to some sacrifice.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>That throughout our entire lives,</p>
  <p><strong>the longest way</strong>, was the only way.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We must each climb the highest of mountains,</p>
  <p>it is how we grow, it is how we bloom,</p>
  <p>it is how the Greatest of Heights will Ensue.</p>
