    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Bad Grades Are Meaningless Grades</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have to punch through what everyone else is saying,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if something feels wrong, you walk, you get out, you don't let people push you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Long time ago, we had these little schools,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that taught reading, writing, and arithmetic.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And people loved them, everyone loved and admired them,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it was a true gift, and teachers were True Angels of Wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But schools require funding,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">part of that funding is paying teachers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And what that means is:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">money.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Everyone suddenly was a teacher,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and to optimize money, testing, testing, testing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is not a school anymore,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this is a business, all the teachers now take a paycheck home.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The concept of grades is very iffy, very lazy, a teacher should talk to the parent.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if grades used to work, then maybe they didn't matter much, somehow.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But over time,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with everyone busy optimizing things to get or make more money.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">With schools everywhere needing funding,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with teachers needing to get paid.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Nobody would have noticed,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when grades became everything.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Same with tests, nobody noticed when lectures became too abstract,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and people just started memorizing for tests to get good grades.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So now, we have a school, that needs funding,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">teachers that need to get paid.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And lectures and tests,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">setup in a way where majority passes by memorization.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And then there are those who assume that teachers are there to teach,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and that the abstract disconnected lectures actually make sense.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They don't know everyone is memorizing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they assume they are just not smart enough.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">C, and D, an occasional B+. but mostly Cs,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it wouldn't occur to them that teachers are looking at other classes and give the same grade.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Nor would it occur to them that statistically a certain number of students,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">should have bad grades, and the teacher will make that happen as not to stick out.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And then there is the big one, the biggie,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the one that nobody talks about, that inconvenient fact.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The grades, are actually a performance score of how well the teacher is teaching,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and they have not a darn thing to do with any of the students.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You can't learn disconnected facts,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you can only temporarily memorize them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your grades are are reflection of how inclined you are to participate in a memorization charade,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that fetches the teacher money, and keeps your school operating.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They have to get paid,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they have to put food on their table.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They can't teach, because that would mean addressing every student,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that is just not possible, and they would rather get a job elsewhere.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">More importantly, they won't know, they won't even care, when you do find something that you like,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they will take that away you, because there is no time for you to learn, you have to pass tests that are in class right now.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you don't pass the standardized tests that are an insult to your uniqueness, your predispositions, talents and creativity,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the teacher will have to be transferred to another school as a <span>lemon<sup>[1]</sup></span> and that makes them look bad.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">How dare you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">how dare you little child.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They will behave high and mighty,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">while selling your mind for a paycheck.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do yo see?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">do you see?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The tests were never a judgment of you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they are just the simplest way to track who the worst teachers are.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Everything that surrounds you in school is created with the least amount of effort,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they are using grades to make you feel bad, so that you will memorize and pretend to learn, so that everyone keeps getting paid.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That is what the teacher wants,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">put food on the table.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They don't know what it means to get bad grades,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the fact that they are a teachers shows that they crammed, memorized and probably were proud of their meaningless grades.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is so strange that someone solving a math problem with memorized formulas, thinks that they understand it - they don't,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they must understand how the formulas work, and it is easy and beautiful.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To begin learning mathematics for real, you need to even out the playing field with a simple programming language,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because to quote <span>Math As Code<sup>[2]</sup></span>, "Mathematical symbols can mean different things depending on the author, context and the field of study (linear algebra, set theory, etc)."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So, you aren't even learning real math,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and beyond that as you create or re-create your formulas in a simple programming language, it makes sense to plug them in, and create interactive visualizations.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And of course, before you start learning math, you need a reason to lean math, which would be creating computer games,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">designing Screen Savers, Music Visualizations, Generative Art, or Generative Music, even stuff for making videos.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">More than that, you can't learn math when someone tells you to,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">your mind has to be ready, and that may take a long time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And you need to see the full picture, because as fun as Generative Art is,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you need to know why you need it...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The reason why you need generative art,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is so that you may exhibit your works at Guggenheim, creating another product line, or helping students learn how to be more like you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The point of it all, is to build a breathtaking portfolio,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">describing a series of companies that you built.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I can't even imagine what schools must think we are,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">for them to treat us the way they do, and where exactly are they directing us?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">College, Debt and Cubicle? ... College, Brand Name University, and Lab?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And for how long, for ever? In a cubicle? Or is it until we start dreaming about opening up our own business - because we can do that as teenagers, and actually learn something for real in the process.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We are each unique, we have different curiosities that mark natural starting points for real education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but they will all lead to art, computers, and sciences, AND in a way that actually empowers you, makes you more powerful.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Bad grades, are just a sign that schools only care about funding,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and teachers only care about getting you to pretend to know, so that they get paid.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Bad grades are not real,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they just reveal the reality of fake education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are just as smart as everyone else,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and your rejection of blind memorization is a sign of and affinity for great authenticity, I'll let you discover where that will take you, on your own.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For all the naysayers, and apologetic teachers with great excuses,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the principals, and the students with perfect grades, I understand what you are saying.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But that is not worth a single student crying her self to sleep at night,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because her grades and teachers are trying to convince her she is stupid, because she is failing your stupid make-believe schools that will lead all into debt and stress.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I honestly believe that people with bad grades,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">mature faster, and are in a way gifted, but schools trick them and show them that they have no future, and sometimes this robs them of their beautiful gift.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All the schools are not worth,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a single student crying her self to sleep.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All of these thoughts can be easily dismissed as a conspiracy theory,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">until we rephrase them as accusations of fraud.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">let us ask.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Why are schools getting funding,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when graduating student do not feel that they have received a real education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Why are grades being used on students,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when they do more damage than good.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Why is there a standard curriculum,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when everybody has different curiosities, a different pace of learning, and holds a unique constellation of knowledge.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">How can an institution refer to it self as a school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">when it causes stress that often leads to tears, and low self esteem.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Furthermore,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Standardized schools have a tendency to convince students to spend their parents money or go into debt from overpriced college,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a paid education, with unforgivable debt, with a significant percentage of students pushed into drugs and alcohol.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The jobs that college graduates get are often less than advertised,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">terrible job interviews, with bad starting salaries, and awful entry level positions.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All of this shows signs of fraud, neglect, and lies, and more lies.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All of this can be repaired with a Personalized Education with the Aid of Computers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and with a focus on building small companies that will help the students to financial independence, rather than debt.</div>
