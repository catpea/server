  <p>Do not drop out of High School,</p>
  <p>the Back Row is a special place.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is how the Universe asks for help,</p>
  <p>you are being asked to watch for trouble.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>To keep an eye on your bullies,</p>
  <p>make sure they all come back from home.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Their violence is an expression of abuse,</p>
  <p>there is nothing you can do.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You are being asked to stare into the Teachers Soul,</p>
  <p>especially when the bullies come, and she turns her head.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And you are being asked to be the first one to call the police,</p>
  <p>if someone is in danger, get everything on video, upload.</p>

  <p>So, by now the teachers have you half way,</p>
  <p>towards believing that you are dumb, a loser, and a waste of time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>They have been using you to tidy up their Grade Statistics,</p>
  <p>their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzSnvxejenY">statistics can&apos;t stick out</a>, they need a usual distribution of grades.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>If it was all As, someone would come around asking why,</p>
  <p>you are the &quot;F&quot; that makes their bullshit look legitimate.</p>

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I know, you know, that your grades your bad, because you were not learning before,</p>
  <p>and now you don&apos;t have the base, that would help you understand what the teacher is saying right now.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But you are wrong.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Nobody else learned that stuff either,</p>
  <p>even some of the kids that had tutors, didn&apos;t learn it, they just memorized it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You&apos;d have to be a freak of nature,</p>
  <p>to actually comprehend that curriculum, please, please, don&apos;t memorize garbage.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Be careful, the teachers, and principals maybe suffering a kind of collective delusion:</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>&quot;...The principal and I rejected his alibi and hung a fat zero on his final exam.</p>
  <p>That dropped his precalculus grade down from a B+ to a D+.</p>
  <p>It lingered like a purple bruise on his college applications.&quot;</p>

  <p>Forgive the memorizes, they are often under as much pressure as the bullies are,</p>
  <p>they are just better at keeping their mind from fracturing.</p>

  <p>Some of them maybe admiring you,</p>
  <p>that you are so strong that you don&apos;t pretend to learn.</p>

  <p>Every formula animated before student&apos;s eyes, paid internships all around the word,</p>
  <p>student exchange will be the first and foremost, adventures in England, Germany, Australia, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein, and why not.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Student Stipend will grant the students years of Enlightenment and Adventure,</p>
  <p>the only grade will be their own path of education from Middle-school to University,</p>
  <p>all their curiosities combined together into a Hard Cover book,</p>
  <p>that others may follow and improve upon in a Fellowship of Enlightenment.</p>
