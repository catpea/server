  <div class="paragraph">"He was given a corn seed and told to plant it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just as the stalk was beginning to grow, the young warrior would jump over the small stalk many, many times.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Each day the stalk would grow; each day the child would jump.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Soon the stalk was higher than the child's head, but that wouldn't stop him.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Finally, if he failed to clear the stalk, he would be given a new seed and would begin over.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Eventually, there was no stalk that the young ninja could not leap over."</div>

  <div class="paragraph">An endurance based workout,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is about constantly pushing your body to adapt and use energy reserves.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Endurance workouts,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are rooted in gradually increasing complexity.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If your exercise is always the same,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you can't say that you are increasing your endurance.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you are choking yourself, crushing yourself with overwhelming weights,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you are not increasing your endurance efficiently.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Above all,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in a proper endurance workout...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are always sweating,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and that means you are losing electrolytes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You must replenish those,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or you will start getting dehydration headaches.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is easier to prevent dehydration,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">than to treat it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">According to Wikipedia <span>sweat contains<sup>[1]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">sodium (0.9 gram/liter), potassium (0.2 g/L), calcium (0.015 g/L), and magnesium (0.0013 g/L).</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This will vary, some say greatley and there are tests that you can perform,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by wearing a patch during a workout and then analyzing the minerals absorbed by the patch.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Search the internet for "<span>The Gatorade Gx Sweat Patch was weird, neat, and ultimately kind of pointless<sup>[2]</sup></span>",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and note that there are two more links on the bottom to the <span>$200 LEVELEN&#x2122; Athlete Sweat Test Kit<sup>[3]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the <span>$1,000 MX3 Sweat Sodium Test<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I suspect that it would take several $50 patches to establish a decent baseline,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if you have a stable exercise, in a climate controlled gym.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If it gets warmer and/or more humid outside, you body will try to cool it self more,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if you push yourself harder everyday then your readings may fluctuate.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But you should be aware of <span>Oral Rehydration Therapy<sup>[5]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the fact that the use of homemade solutions has not been well studied.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And you have to be careful,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because <span>Overhydration is just as dangerous, if not more dangerous than Dehydration<sup>[6]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You see there is no perfect formula here,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the only way to do this right is to have a competent professional monitor you daily to create a proper profile.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But, headaches are a sign that you are doing something wrong,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the color of your urine may hint if you are dehydrated or not.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And drinking empty water,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is probably not optimal, you want to have some electrolytes in there, but not too much.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Keep track of how much water you lose during your exercise by weighting yourself before an after,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">make sure to account for bathroom trips, water intake, wet clothes, and heavy shoes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Then make sure to drink enough to replace that lost weight,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in a reasonable amount of time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Be careful and wise,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as it is possible to get ill from exercise.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Endurance training is not just about triathlons,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it can be as unique as walking the Appalachian Trail and even the Western States 100 route, that Ultras run during a proper race.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It can be as unique as dancing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">your training must match where you are, without hurting or stopping you, and must help you become healthier.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Endurance training isn't about how far or fast you are going,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is about whether or not it is helping your body become stronger and healthier.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">An endurance race is a strange concept,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we should not push our bodies to a breaking point, we have to be kind to ourselves.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">We need to *slowly* progress forward at our own natural pace,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there is no glory in becoming ill from exercise, being healthy is the only reward that truly mattes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My personal recommendation is dancing at your local gym,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is easy on the knees, and provides all the bored people pretending to work out with entertainment.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And I recommend <span>shuffle dancing<sup>[7]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you'll never have a bad or boring workout, all shuffle dance workouts are pure joy and cheerfulness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When people laugh they are not laughing at you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they are either laughing at the strange world we live in, or are laughing with you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Focus on gaining endurance,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and enjoy being cheerful and healthy.</div>
</div>
