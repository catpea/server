      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Job Interview Tips: They won&#39;t ask you questions that have answers.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So everything you memorized,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">goes straight out the window.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You will be thrown against questions without answers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and judged based on the methods you use to eventually fail.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is the quality of your thinking,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">not the solution of the problem that gets you the position.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Supply and demand, money...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you've been made to memorize answers to trick puzzles since high school.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The entrance exams,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are little more than crossword puzzles.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And the whole educational experience between middle school and university, inclusive,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is about people making money off of you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For the same reason why military does not recruit middle aged men,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">why the only go after the ones that didn't have a chance to become wise yet.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Businesses grow in places where there is money,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and there is money in selling promises of futures.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And this is not a secret,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">especially when it comes to real jobs.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Not jobs that will train you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but ones that expect you to lead as an innovator.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So the interview process, is not about how many solutions to entrance exam puzzles you memorized,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but about the puzzles that do not come with solutions, at all.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I know what you are thinking,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you are not smart enough to lead, and try to solve those problems.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You had a tough time inn school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and nobody knows the you worked twice as hard.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This isn't about the school at all,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the school is a theater that puts on a play.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The play sustains it self,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it propagates it self, it is self referential, it exist for its own sake.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The twice as hard is there for everyone,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is there to convince you that it is worth the while.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But, it is not, worth the while,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is not worth the diploma anymore.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Look at med school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is just a few more tests, AND THEN A DECADE OF PRACTICE.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This right here should tell you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">how useful you school is.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Hence questions without answers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">questions that test your ability to think outside of the box.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Questions that have nothing to do with formulas or facts you memorized,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and have everything to do with things you have never encountered before.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In deed that you paid for an education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that you would have gained on your own had you been more responsible is a huge red minus.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You got yourself tricked,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and now you don't even know the job is after the best decades of your life, and whatever is best in your mind.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The interview will be testing the greatness of your being,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">all the fields outside of the position you seek.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They will expect to see a demonstration of the breadth of your knowledge,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by watching you apply solutions from other fields by a simple and subtle analogy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Mind you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">schools only taught you a single path.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Only one question out of the multiple was correct.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And here it is even more complex,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because there is no answer.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is a question of scanning for a solution,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that does not exist.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The reason why you are being asked questions without answers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is to reveal the number and quality of attempts at the solution before you realize or are told that there is no answer.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is the quality intricacy and complexity of the search for the solution,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that is being evaluated.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But there is friction here,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because a real interview that does not actually insult you, approaches your soul all too close.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All your genius, even if schools tricked you into believing you don't have it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and all the while asking you to trust them they will be there for you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That they will be there when you are thirty and build not just a house but a home,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they will be there when you are forty and try to live a healthier and more balanced life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they will be there when you are fifty, and sixty, and maybe seventy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In their inexperience they are challenging your soul, and your greatness,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and asking you to give it to them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The best interview tip I have for you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is to go there to question them instead.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Ask them how much of you do they expect you to give,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and how much is your pay in proportion to the CEO.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And how long do they expect yo to work there,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and how much do they think years of your life are really worth.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I recommend you ask that same question,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">at every interview...</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">and learn to no end,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">how your job is not that different from the minimal almost fake education that took your savings.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The answer to the original question that brought you here,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">was not College and Career.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It was Self Education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and Entrepreneurship.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You took the road more traveled,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the first stretch took your money, and the second will take your decades so you can pay off the debt.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And you better have huge debt,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because if you don't, then you don't even have a reason to go in to the interview.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Either way,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">this is not the way.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Every year of your life,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is infinitely more valuable, than anything you will find, working for somebody else.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So stop it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">stop now before it is too late.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are meant to learn for real,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you are mean to be truly knowledgeable, far beyond anything that can be asked at an interview.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No matter their zest for genius,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they wouldn't come up with a question to capture one, their very position and approach is proof they wouldn't know what one looks like.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As you can no doubt tell,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a lot behind those questions is there so that they can impress themselves.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But enough about that stupid interview,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that is not the way, that is not your way.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have been misled by education and the promise of a safe job,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">today all of this still just about moneymaking.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have been spread thin,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you must pull yourself back together.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have to go back and restore the predispositions that schools stripped yo off,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in their haste to sell your mind for a paycheck, and later for your tuition.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Your unique predispositions are the only key to your future,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you may think to yourself that you only had one, and it was ridiculously child like.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Yes, that is what a predisposition for greatness emerges as initially,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a childhood curiosity.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And then as you tend to it it will fork and grow like a large corona,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you will enter stages of Art and Music, Uniqueness and Creativity, you will zoom right past being a Genius and a Polymath, and learn things worth a thousand times more.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So many things, that those asking those interview questions will look infantile,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it will feel like a bunch of actors trying to make themselves look bigger either by caring to much r pretending to care too little.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Enough is enough,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and no, it won't work temporary.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You need those years to grow,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">not to rent them out to bigger than thou ding-dongs.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Finally, I am canceling your interview tomorrow,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because it is a waste of your time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Instead you are going shopping to prepare for an expedition,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">find the longest Adventure Trail wherever you live, Appalachian, Pacific Crest, whatever, and pack.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Get a Journal and a waterproof marker,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and discover the polymath in you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When you return,</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>build a series of small companies until you learn how to do it right<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And never again follow,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and never again let someone tell you who you are, or smart you are, or where you need to be, or how much you are worth to them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Be mindful of your legacy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and of those who are being misguided right now, help them learn, prevent them from making the same mistakes you did.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The world stands still, today, the politics are frozen, even the police kills those who they are sworn to protect,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the World can only grow when you and countless others unleash the Genius, the Polymath, and the Greatness, within.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">No interview,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you are meant to become a great being.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The World needs you to lead,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">no more dumb interviews there isn't a company noble enough, there isn't a company worthy of your time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is not the kind of a world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">each generation must progress forward, what you see before you is not fixed, it is just an imperfect stepping stone froward.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Stop letting others search for you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and set of on an endless adventure to <span>discover the great being within<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>
