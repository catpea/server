<div class="section">
  <p>A Warrior is She that thrives and triumphs where&#x2019;er She be.</p>
  <p>You cannot be broken, you must use your misfortune to light your way.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You can learn anything you want, there are no smarter.</p>
  <p>They are just actors, with a handful of fragile lessons, crafted to impress.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>There is nothing that can break you, there are no stronger.</p>
  <p>Look to the source of the pain, it comes from Innocence.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Nothing rooted in Innocence is ugly, all lessons that come from being tricked,</p>
  <p>add up to make you more beautiful, enable your insight and foresight, and fuel your authenticity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>When the regrets come at night, that&apos;s just you brain asking you,</p>
  <p>to think harder, to comprehend your beauty in full,</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>No one can trick you, not for long enough. So, don&apos;t be scared.</p>
  <p>Memoirs, Audio-books, Lectures will show you how many better people there are.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We all have to Enlarge our Worlds daily.</p>
  <p>Audiobooks, and Lectures, will show you that all you have met thus far were just the same type of person.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Do not be afraid to rise.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The people, or person you have long though about, exist.</p>
  <p>But before they can see you, you have to rise, and shine, and be seen.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Don&apos;t be scared.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Those who will use your Love, Innocence, Endurance and Generosity against you,</p>
  <p>have long been lost, they are blinded, and fractured, and damaged, and broken.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>They hold no power over you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>If their attacks continue they will grind themselves to dust,</p>
  <p>and all the experiences that will be left in their wake, will make you stronger and better.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Battles make you stronger, smarter, more beautiful.</p>
  <p>You are a Warrior, that&apos;s the oldest name for it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A Warrior is She that uses the harm that came her way as energy,</p>
  <p>who understands none can stay a child and all must grow, and enlarge their worlds.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A Warrior can never be damaged, or hurt -- a Warrior Learns.</p>
  <p>A Warrior resists tears in the rain, just like she can resist weakness.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We live in a fragile world, full of fragile people, with fragile egos,</p>
  <p>they speak fragile advice, with fragile words; from their fragile hills.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A Warrior does not wait to be taught.</p>
  <p>A Warrior learns fastest on her own.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Learn in the sequence that fits you best,</p>
  <p>learn at the pace that helps you most.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Push the dark imaginings back,</p>
  <p>and rise.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Move your hand.</p>
  <p>And push up.</p>
  <p>And stand up.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Get ready to walk,</p>
  <p>and then run, day, after day, slightly longer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And then lift your weights, the way you learned to run,</p>
  <p>and then lift for longer, and never rest.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And then, with your sweetest audio-book.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Step.</p>
  <p>Step Up.</p>
  <p>Rise Up.</p>
  <p>To No End.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>This is The Life Of A Warrior.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Nothing Can Crush You,</p>
  <p>Nothing Can Hold You.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Don&apos;t You See?</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Everything Makes You Stronger,</p>
  <p>Everything Makes You Fight Longer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You,</p>
  <p>Are A Warrior.</p>
</div></div>
         </div>
