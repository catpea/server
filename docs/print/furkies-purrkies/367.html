      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">On Finding A Path To Greatness</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Above all, begin paying attention to your mental well being,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">whatever is causing you harm, get away from it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you think you can't get away from it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then find a relative that will take you in.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you don't have relatives,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then you will have to talk to your best friend's parents.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You can't stay in a place that is stressing you out,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you need a place that is safe, a place where you can think.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And then begin thinking about building a company,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or a tiny business, at first just for learning.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Everyone says it is not easy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">people say they get burned out, overworked.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But that is the wrong approach,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you need to be whole.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is a little passage in the Ranger Creed,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that nobly emphasizes just that.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">"Never shall I fail my comrades. I will always keep myself mentally alert, physically strong and morally straight and I will shoulder more than my share of the task whatever it may be, one-hundred-percent and then some.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Mentally alert means, you take care of your mind,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that you are rested, that you are free.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do not let mediocrity, liars, cheaters, pretenders hurt your mind,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you have to be mentally alert, mentally well enough to easily go above and beyond.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Please allow me to make a note here, I'll make it brief,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">people are stressed out by fake education, more and more drugs are becoming accessible.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Furthermore, there maybe schools that in their evil will attempt to diagnose people with states of mind that woudn't exist,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if it wasn't for the insanity of school.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Sir Ken Robinson, called unusually high number of prescriptions for ADHD a sign of a "<span>A Fictitious Epidemic<sup>[1]</sup></span>",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and fake schools will cause depression in a healthy mind, that is how it works,</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If schools start medicating the kids they depressed,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then even if you want school, get out, get out as fast as you can.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And remember liars are never obvious,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">liars always live in the twilight, there will be no proof, no evidence, just better grades and better profits.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Be careful,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is that kind of a world, I am sorry.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Mental Well Being, is Number One,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">number two, is somewhat related, especially if you are in middle school or high school.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The first thing you need is an upgrade on you view of the world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the way you inherit a more sophisticated intellectual culture is Audio Books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They are not free,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">they should be free for people under 21.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is no one book, it will take over a hundred Audio Books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">- and you know this, this one is not easy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">With a hundred books, you will create a self-balancing view of the world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and in the process inherit character traits from many of your favorite authors.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Intellectual Inheritance,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is just another way of saying growing up by reading books.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is one of the reasons why you need a safe place, a safe space,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so that you may grow up, uninterrupted by things that are not worthy of you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is one sure way to accelerate your intellectual growth,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but you need three more friends, at least, and you need to be in your 20s or up.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">An that is taking to the trails,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">don't do this alone, please.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In United States we have The Appalachian Trail,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and The Pacific Crest Trail.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Bring your Audiobooks, Bear Spray, and an Air Horn (bears don't like loud sounds),</div>
  <div class="paragraph">especially if it is four horns going off at the same time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Ignore people that say you don't need the horn,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">just activate it until they walk away.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Bring your journal,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and grow.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The biggest problems you face when you are young,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is a smaller grasp of self awareness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is a function of our brain still growing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the genetic predispositions to follow orders, to follow what your teachers tell you for example.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are also building a view of the world,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and stuff that isn't real is polluting it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So, schools are forcing you into memorization, and each semester you have little to show for it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">especially if you ask yourself: "What if I just spent five months learning how to use a Digital Audio Workstation?"</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You would be able to compose music, probably in just a week,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">by the fifth month you would be publishing your second album on bandcamp, and with some advertising, you could make probably more than a $100 a month.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even so, you tell yourself, schools are important,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I need schools, because schools get me to college, and perhaps med school.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You probably don't go as far as pondering the $241,600 average unforgivable student loan debt,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because you can just pay it off after you get the job.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This is why you need a hundred of those Audio Books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if you want to be a doctor, then in your first hundred books ten will be about becoming one, and a couple about the regrets.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But it is more than just shining light on your career,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is about shining light on the way you make choices.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You can't jump forward,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you have to move precisely deliberately.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You have to start in High School to be a Doctor,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you have to love it, it has to call to you, you may do part time at a veterinary clinic, and maybe work at a retirement home.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just waiting for Med School to make you a Doctor is not enough,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you have to love making your way there, it has to inspire you, fuel you, it has to make you happy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Self awareness means that you know where you are,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and you know a clear and stable path towards the future.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In terms of becoming a Doctor, everything that is covered in the first two years of med school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you have to cover on your own in the first two years of high school, just as a function of curiosity.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Something in you has to ask, what is MCAT and MLE about... anyways?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and then you go shopping for a microscope, and might as well pick up a stethoscope and take interest in the heath of your gerbil, or cat.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In other words, in terms of becoming a Doctor, memorization is required,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">even though it is not effective, and pretty stupid.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And if you take to using what you memorized without double checking,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then you will get in trouble.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just as a side-note, the right way of doing this,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is not to memorize, but to love so many things about the field that you immediately absorb new information.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Sometimes with tears in your eyes as you deep down know you made a huge breakthrough,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">which means you don't need to memorize it, and will never forget it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And sometimes with passionate anger, at all the idiots that made it too confusing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because they clearly didn't know what they were taking about.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In terms of a more open future,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">where we just say to ourselves I'll just get a good job after I graduate college.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is a different story, because now you are looking at $32,000 to $50,000 in debt,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and memorizing things that you will forget when you start your job.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You know when Police stops you, and ask you "Do you know what you did wrong?",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to get you to admit to whatever it is, to make their job easier, and a fool out of you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Jobs do the same thing they will say Entry Position, Experience Required,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so that during the interview, they can say "we can't pay you that much, because you do not have the experience we asked for".</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In this situation, Self Awareness translates to asking:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"do I want to work for such a company?"</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Do you want to work for a company,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that is already trying to take advantage of you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">After four years of high school and four years of college,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and with $32,000 to $50,000 of unforgivable debt, plus your credit cards, and other tricks.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You are now being insulted,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">on your happy interview day.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You need to consider this,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and you need to consider what it is like to work in a cubicle for the rest of your life.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Not only are you looking at eight years of school,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but about 80 years of working in a box, or worse an open space where you can hear all the moth breathers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Self awareness means intercepting mistakes before they happen,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">again only renowned Audio Books by good narrators, written by highly respected and loved authors will help you with this.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">At least a hundred books,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there is a video of <span>Stanford Commencement Address that Steve Jobs gave in 2005<sup>[2]</sup></span>, that you may wish to see.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Despite what Mr. Jobs says about the dots,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you can connect them, it is the job of you increasing your self awareness with books to connect them.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You do not go forward into the future merely trusting your gut, or destiny, life, karma, whatever,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because the world is full of people that will take advantage of that blind expectation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So you absolutely need to take care of your mental well being,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and expansion of your self awareness by listening to dozens and dozens of audio books highly valued by their readers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even by just watching how Steve Jobs carries him self,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">how he talks about college tuition, he is gently and in very classy way pealing apart that fraud.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is the first and foremost thing he brings up,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because he refuses to be a part of it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">To name a few of my most influential figures:</div>

  </ul>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There is this one talk by Richard Dawkins that I really like,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there is a video titled "<span>Richard Dawkins - The God Delusion Q&A at Liberty University<sup>[22]</sup></span>"</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Liberty University (LU) is a private evangelical Christian university in Lynchburg, Virginia,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that Q&A was destined for greatness.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A young lady poses a question "What if you're wrong?",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and this is my private opinion: I think she was aiming at Pascal's Wager, but Richard Dawkins response was a lot more elaborate than shooting fish in a barrel.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Search the internet for a video entitled "<span>PHILOSOPHY - Religion: Pascal's Wager<sup>[23]</sup></span>" for more information on Pascal's Wager,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">which also includes a bespectacled cartoon kitty named Richard Pawkins.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And between you and I the gambit it shutdown with an argument for authenticity,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if someone believes something purely for personal gain then they can't be invited to a serious discussion.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But the Pascal's Wager interpretation of what this humble young lady is asking about, is just my personal opinion,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and Richard Dawkins takes it his own way.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Which resulted in a <span>wonderfully animated Richard Dawkins in a South Park cartoon<sup>[24]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I love that little smile of accomplishment at the end, but more than that, I love the audience.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The sound of the Audience at Liberty University,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">tells me that we are still headed for the Stars.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But again the reason I bring this up in no uncertain terms is:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Inheritance of Class, and Culture, and expansion of our awareness of the world, and how we fit in it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just observing the way that Richard Dawkins carries him self,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and hearing the cheer and laughter by all the wonderful people in the audience, helped me expand my personal vision of the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Here is another side of Richard Dawkins, and even more giggles,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">a two part Extravaganza.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Part one "<span>Hate E-mails with Richard Dawkins<sup>[25]</sup></span>",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the second batch "<span>Love Letters to Richard Dawkins<sup>[26]</sup></span>".</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Search internet videos for Richard Dawkins in 1991 presenting <span>Growing Up in the Universe<sup>[27]</sup></span>, a series of five lectures,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">held at the Royal Institution in London.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>Royal Institution Christmas Lectures<sup>[28]</sup></span> are a great tradition and a great honor,</div>

  <div class="paragraph">He also created an hour and a half long documentary,</div>

  <div class="paragraph">When you are stuck, cramming for tests, you can ask what would Richard do,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">would he sit here pretending to get educated, would he try to change schools, talk to the principal, or give a set of banned lectures on how the school only cares that everyone gets paid.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">And number three, is business,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we all have different interests.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is tough to give general business advice,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but; setting up a laboratory where you tutor med students helping them see through a microscope or visualization what they are attempting to blindly memorize.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you are inclined towards science, then programming languages can be used as a kind of a microscope,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you can examine any complex system or theory by writing a tiny simulation, or implementation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you are not sure where you are headed, then begin writing a Science Journal, let other scientist publish or peer review,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and you can stay in the field without having to work 26 hour shifts for $300, remember number 1, your well being is most important.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Away from the laboratories, in my private opinion is where the party is,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">unconstrained by any field in particular you can do, everything.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">For one, 3D printing is awesome, and you can find it as a service online too,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you can sculpt in clay 3D scan it and then miniaturize them and open up a little jewelry store on <span>Shapeways<sup>[30]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You can open up a First Person View <span>Drone Racing circuit<sup>[31]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and perhaps have a yearly competition for automatically operated drones only.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph"><span>With an Office Projector and some Plywood Sheathing you can begin painting 8ft murals<sup>[32]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph"><span>follow the Old Masters<sup>[33]</sup></span>, create the gray version of your painting first, and then add color glaze to achieve perfect portrait every time.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Remember, to <span>desaturate a color you mix it with the opposite on the color wheel<sup>[34]</sup></span>,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there is an exception for the primaries, you mix the full triad, secondary colors already consist of two colors, so you just add the opposite, and that makes the triad.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As with Science, you must be lead by you passion,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">everything you do has to be inspired.</div>
</div>

  <div class="paragraph">to have no need for memorization, you simply integrate the new to the great library within you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">While I can't show you the direction you must move towards to create your business,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there is a guiding idea that will help you along.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A self published, full color book,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that serves as your portfolio.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It will contain your design sketches,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and photographs of your complete work.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This will help you get clients,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or get hired by a large company.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">

  <div class="paragraph">Schools will forever be a prosthetic,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">even if they do transform into a personalized education experience.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You need to pursue an independent plan,</div>
