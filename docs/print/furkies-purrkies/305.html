      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">Prevention</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That is all you get to save the world with,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if it was easy somebody else would have done it already.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Next time you're in class, look at the back row,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">one of them is a genius who does not believe in the world anymore, the rest need help, the sooner the better.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I know you can prevent them from fracturing,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I know you have it in you to save the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All around the world, liars stretch accepted patterns they hardly understand, like a bubble gum, and with perfect deniability,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there is no blame, there is no proof, there are no laws that could help here, nothing can be done to fix anything.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But also nothing that Humanity needs,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">has been lost permanently.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The state of things as we see today,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">can be prevented from re-occurring come next-generation by means of real education, and prevention of emergence of desperate creatures that become perfect liars.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The same goes for criminals,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the idea of stealing an ATM to become free comes from little more than Saturday morning cartoons and desperation.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">With real politics and wise politicians, we will see Universal Basic Income come into reality,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and nobody is going to rob anything if they already have the money and live a life of Knowledge, Authenticity, and Dignity.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As unbelievable as it sounds, Prevention coupled with Real Education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that guides people towards Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness, is where Humanity will find its future.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Once liars take to power, we can only wait for them to retire,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and while we are waiting we have to help children grow so that they will become the Great Beings that will may their place.</div>
