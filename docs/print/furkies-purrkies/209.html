  <p>The simplest, most resilient, tested and lasting unit of information,</p>
  <p>that can transfer large amounts of knowledge between Human Beings, is a book.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Reading a raw book is like eating soup from a can,</p>
  <p>it is very nutritious, it tastes OK, it is fine, but there is a better way.</p>

  <p>To improve a book we can use a capable narrator to read it, and record it,</p>
  <p>creating an audio book that we can bring with us on an adventure.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>For example, we can pack a day pack and go to a nearby State Park with long winding trails,</p>
  <p>along the way we can relax, enjoy the season, the atmosphere, and learn.</p>

  <p>Combining a Nature Walk with the Audio Book version,</p>
  <p>reveals the original paper book for what it really is.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>A paper book is about long term storage of ideas that can be archived for ages,</p>
  <p>and enjoyed for hundreds if not thousands of years.</p>

  <p>A book should be decoded from text to audio,</p>
  <p>only then can we fully process the ideas that the author wants to share.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>To back up this claim, think of a Business asking employees to read a particular book,</p>
  <p>would it not be much better to help the employees to a day off an gift them a well narrated audio version?</p>

  <p>A good book is more than just a thing to be read line by line,</p>
  <p>a book not only contains ideas and tools for thinking but also the author at the time of writing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>To read a book for real, we really have to hear the author speak,</p>
  <p>we have to be able to feel their Soul, Heart, and Spirit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Should the author prove worthy we should become friends with them across space and time,</p>
  <p>perhaps even make them part of our extended family and put their photo near or on the Fireplace Mantel.</p>

  <p>A good book, is a book that makes us a better person by transferring some hard earned wisdom,</p>
  <p>a kind of timeless love, that helps the world to become a wiser and better place.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Much of the World is still divided by imaginary borders,</p>
  <p>the division relies on political, religious and cultural indoctrination presenting a subset of reality, if not warping it entirely.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Making wisdom more accessible, especially to young people who learn the fastest and are about to face challenges previously unseen,</p>
  <p>is more than just a good idea, it is our moral duty.</p>

  <p>I ask all the companies who hold the ability to release meaningful audio-books to students, to do so, right now,</p>
  <p>we should not hope to make money by restricting or impeding access to knowledge,</p>
  <p>not to the generation that now faces the problems we were unable to stop ourselves from propagating.</p>
