      <div class="paragraph" style="font-weight: bold;">How To Easily Learn Anything And Everything</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">First of all, you can't just pick a subject out of the blue,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">nor can anybody tell you what you need to learn.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you are forced to learn something under a threat,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you are likely to memorize it, and thus create the wrong impression of the subject.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Saying "I hate math",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and keeping away from mathematical things is not healthy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Saying "I hate school math.", and "I hate the way they teach math",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is correct.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Schools do not distinguish between forcing you to memorize something,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and you actually learning something for real.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">This helps them increase graduation rates,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and keep getting funding, they depend on you pretending to learn.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Personally, I think the threat of failing a class,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">makes it so that it is wiser (in that context) to pretend to learn by memorizing.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">It is not just one class that is broken,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is many overlapping classes, with disconnected and irrelevant subjects.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There may not _be a way_ to learn it all for real,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as the class curricula evolved along side students pretending to learn.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Just in case you need to hear it - and you shouldn't need to rely on hearing somebody else say it...</div>
  <div class="paragraph">schools are bad for us, they don't work, they probably can't work.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">A real school would pay you for grades,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it would help you move into your own apartment, not a dorm room.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And it would help you begin saving money,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you would graduate with enough money to buy a house, car, and start a little business.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In return, your level of education,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">would help your city, and nation, grow stronger, grow collectively wiser.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The money you would get from schools,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is just an investment in your nations future.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Happy and well educated graduates,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">create a Happy and Well Educated, and Wise, Nation; and soon afer a Wiser World.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Right now, our wisest Politicians, the greatest beings in Politics,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are fighting for a livable minim wage, which is to say doubling the minimum wage.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And the companies that will have to pay double,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">are probably getting ready to cut their workforce in half, with automation and computers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I greatly admire these politicians, and they bring tears to my eyes,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but the minimum wage shouldn't be $15 but, at least, $50.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">More than $50 per hour, 40 hours a week,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">full medical insurance, and lots of perks.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Personally, I feel that it should be $75/h,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">not $15.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Not only school is making it impossible to learn,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but working for a large company is severely broken.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You need to ask yourself, what are you pretending to learn,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">in a school that doesn't care about real education?</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">As you graduate higher,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you need to ask if you should be paying for a mediocre education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Why should you sink into years of stressful debt for a diploma,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that will be easily beat by someone with a brand name education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">People with brand name education often have plenty of financial support,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">sometimes their family members went to that school (see Legacy Ivy)</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And later on, you also face the fact that family members tend to recruit family members into companies (nepotism),</div>
  <div class="paragraph">your GPA, Hard Work, Happy Graduation, and a Diploma is not guaranteed to matter to anybody.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The debt you incur, is guaranteed,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you will not be able to file bankruptcy, your school debt will not be forgiven.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The way you can learn anything,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is by accepting the responsibility for your own education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And accepting the responsibility for launching a series of small start-ups,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">as you learn to become an Entrepreneur.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The problem with learning in school is that the information they are forcing you to memorize,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">is too abstract, it is irrelevant to you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">That is why, even if you tried learning for real,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">your knowledge of the subject will be such low quality, that companies won't even want to hire you.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">They prefer candidates with years of experience,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and anyway, you shouldn't be looking for an entry level position after years of studying.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Even though companies asking for years of experience for entry level positions,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">may still grant you a job, it will be - by their own definition - a less than entry level position.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Self Education, and Entrepreneurship, and putting yourself in positions where learning math will be relevant to your success,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">will help you learn for real.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Would you even think to yourself "I hate math",</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if your company worked on <span>self replicating 3D printers<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When you are working in real context, on a meaningful project,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that will help to launch your first company for example, it is never a question of learning, you just do it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When you have a real world context, and an aim that is personally meaningful to you,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">you simply progress forward, you become so passionate about your education.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">If you are not interested in 3D printing, then perhaps you will become interested in something that involves it,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">how about 3D printing fashion, art, musical instruments of apartment buildings for the homeless.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And if there is nothing in the world that can get you into math,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then it will be your top engineer friend who will gently walk you through, seeing that you have great respect for her or him,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but that you struggle to understand what they are doing sometimes.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There are countless pathways that can help you learn anything,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Biology, and Combinatorial Genomics will easily call to you if you take to publishing a Journal Of Anti-aging, for example.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <br>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In conclusion, we can't learn in school, because it is too abstract,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and the risk of failing a class and ruining a GPA is just too great.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But, we can learn if we put ourselves in a position where a subject is relevant to us,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and it is far more than just learning, we become passionate about it.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">By creating our own future, our own job in a company that we build,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we no longer need to rely on minimum wage, and deal with unforgivable debt.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">In a way, especially when we are young, self education becomes a school that does pay us for grades,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there is no better grade, or reward, than running a small and successful, smartly positioned independent business.</div>
