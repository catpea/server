  <p>You are not alone,</p>
  <p>and all you do matters.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>As you rise,</p>
  <p>you create a way for others to follow.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Struggle, like suffering,</p>
  <p>is a gas that fills all the available space.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is never easy for anybody,</p>
  <p>the difference is in the choices we make and the aims we set.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The first Great Choice is to set off towards wisdom,</p>
  <p>to continuously transcend our limits thorough out our entire existence.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>One of the finest choices we can make,</p>
  <p>is to Live Above Common Levels of Life.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>There are no guarantees,</p>
  <p>your choice to proceed forward is all the guarantee there is.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Our biological life is not finely crafted,</p>
  <p>it is a result of fundamental principles of Physics and Chemistry.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But our mind, is up to us to shape,</p>
  <p>hence Audio Books and Lectures and our inheritance from of Other Lives, Times, and Works.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You need not hurry,</p>
  <p>but you do need to slow down so that you may read and write.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

<div class="section">
  <p>We each have a story to tell,</p>
  <p>and many will follow a similar path to ours across the vastness of future.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>They could use some advice,</p>
  <p>a few fine words about rising, about what it is like to see the sun for the first time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Do not let your readers suffer the same loneliness you did,</p>
  <p>let them learn from you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And the way you write,</p>
  <p>is one thought at a time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>So as long as your write about your unlimited travels,</p>
  <p>you never run out of the story to tell.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And every once in a while,</p>
  <p>a poem will leap ahead of you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The thought will arrive,</p>
  <p>from the future before you get there.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You are connected to your future self,</p>
  <p>no one can hold a stronger bond.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>You are a being, with a mind and body, you are in the present,</p>
  <p>but you exist across time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Your Life Line, your Life Time,</p>
  <p>The past you and the future you, are connected.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And just the same those who came before you,</p>
  <p>and those who are yet to follow, are connected to you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But you have to write your thoughts,</p>
  <p>...when you are rising in your childhood,</p>
  <p>the children can understand it best.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>In your early age, as you make your way,</p>
  <p>as you learn to rise, and find your rhythm,</p>
  <p>your readers will be in their twenties.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And then, forties, and then sixties, and eighties, and hundreds,</p>
  <p>at no point in your life should you be ashamed to write,</p>
  <p>or be shamed for writing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Because if you can manage to hold your pen,</p>
  <p>it is more than most others can.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>One thought at a time,</p>
  <p>help others understand how to climb.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Make all your struggles count for more,</p>
  <p>show them how you fought for wisdom in your war.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Tell the world what you know,</p>
  <p>so that others may safely follow.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Know that the first struggles sometimes mean more,</p>
  <p>sometimes the hardest challenge is to get off the floor.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The first steps after all,</p>
  <p>matter the most to those whose worlds may be seem small.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>All steps matter and in many ways,</p>
  <p>all lead to enlightenment, and the Sun&apos;s rays.</p>
